<h3><span class="font1 large">Part I.</span></h3>

<p class="pc1 lmid">PHYSIOGRAPHY OF NORTH AMERICA.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE continents of the earth have two distinct types of form,&mdash;the one regular,
symmetrical, triangular in outline; the other without these regularities of shape.
To the first of these groups belong the continents of Africa and Australia of the Old
World, and the two Americas of the New; to the second, the massive continent of
Europe and Asia. Some have sought to reduce the continent of Asia to the same
type as that of the other continents; but a glance at a map of the hemispheres will
show how different is this Indo-European continent from the other land-masses.</p>

<p>These general features of the continents are not only of scientific interest; they are
of the utmost importance to the history of man’s development upon these several
lands. It is not without meaning, that, while man has existed for a great length of time
upon all the continents, the only original civilizations that have been developed have
been on the lands of the Indo-European continent. Working on several different
lines of advance, several diverse races&mdash;Aryan, Semitic, Chinese, and perhaps others&mdash;have
risen from the common plane of barbarism, and have created complicated
social systems, languages, literatures, and arts; while on the four other continents,
despite their great area, greater fertility, and wider range of physical conditions, no
race has ever had a native development to be compared with that undergone by the
several successful races of Asia and Europe.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>In this great Old-World continent there are many highly individualized areas, each
separated from the rest of the continent by strong geographical barriers; it has a dozen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mii" id="Page_mii">[ii]</a></span>
or so of great peninsulas upon its seaboard, many great islands off its shores, and the
interior of the land is divided into many separated regions by mountain ridges or by
deserts. It is a land where man necessarily fell into variety, because of the isolation
that the geography gave. If we look at the other continents,&mdash;namely, the Americas,
Africa, and Australia,&mdash;we find that they want this varied and detailed structure.
They each consist of a great triangular mass, with scanty subordinate divisions. In
all of them put together there are not so many great peninsulas as there are in
Europe. If we exclude those that are within the Arctic Circle, there are but few
on the four regular continents, none of which compare in size or usefulness to man
with the greater peninsulas of the Old World. The only one of value is that of Nova
Scotia, in North America.</p>

<p>These regular continents are all in the form of triangles, with their apices pointing
towards the southern pole. Near either long shore lie the principal mountain systems
that give definition to the coast line. The middle portion of each continent is
generally a region of plain, somewhat diversified by lesser mountain systems. Along
either shore is a narrow fringe of plain land to the east and west of the main mountain
chains. Near the northern part of the continent, and aiding to define the base
of the triangle, there is another system of mountains having a general east and west
course. With the exception of North America, none of these regular continents have
seas inclosed within their areas,&mdash;such bodies of water as form so striking a feature
in the Asiatic continent, which is indeed a land of mediterranean seas.</p>

<p>In a word, these continents are characteristically as simple as the Asiatic continent
is varied. Their mass is undivided, and their organic or human histories are necessarily
less diversified than in such a land-mass as Asia.</p>

<p>The continent of North America is, of all the triangular continents, the most nearly
akin in its structure to the great Old-World land. In the first place, it is the only one
of these continents that has the same general conditions of climate; then it has a
far greater diversity of form than the similar masses of South America, Africa, and
Australia. North America has several considerable seas inclosed within its limits or
bordering upon its shores; its mountain systems are more varied in their disposition
than in the other regular continents. So that in a way this continent in its structure
lies intermediate between the Asiatic type and what is considered the normal
form of continents.</p>

<p>Although this varied structure of the continent of North America makes it more
fit for the uses of man than the continents of Africa, South America, and Australia,
there are certain considerable disadvantages in its physical conditions. To show the
relation of these evil and fortunate features, it will be necessary for us to consider
the general geography of the continent somewhat in detail.</p>

<p>The point of first importance concerns the distribution of heat and moisture over
the surface of the land; for on these features depends the fitness of the land for all
forms of life. The influences which principally determine the climate of a continent
come to it from the neighboring seas. The moisture arises there, and finds its way
thence to the land; and the heat or coolness which modifies the land climate comes
with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_miii" id="Page_miii">[iii]</a></span></p>

<p>North America faces three oceans. On the north is the extremely cold Arctic
Sea, mostly covered by enduring ice: it is the extreme coldness of this sea, and its
ice-clad character near the continent of America, that in good part causes the great
severity of its winters. Where the Arctic Sea lies against Europe and Asia it is partly
warmed by the Gulf Stream, and so is not completely ice-bound even in winter; but
that part of it which lies near the northern coast of America is ice-bound the whole
year, and the winds that come from it are many degrees below those that come over
open water.</p>

<p>Both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans send streams of warm water against the American
coast. But the Gulf Stream has actually very little direct effect upon our
climate; it only touches the coast about the Gulf of Mexico, where the temperature
is naturally so high that its warming power is not felt. It then leaves our coast,
to give its warmth to the shores of Europe and to the European part of the Arctic
Ocean. The Pacific current corresponding to the Gulf Stream is feebler than the
Atlantic current, and sends its tide of waters against the northwest shore of America.
Its effects on that coast are very noticeable; but they are limited, by the geography of
that shore, within narrow bounds. In the first place, the passage of Behring’s Strait is
too small to permit its waters to have access to the Arctic Sea; then the high ranges
of the Cordilleras fence off the interior of the continent, so that the warm winds that
blow from the sea cannot penetrate far to the east. Confined to the shore, the heat of
the Pacific Gulf Stream generates a large amount of fog; this fog shuts off the sun’s rays,
and so lowers the temperature almost as much as the current itself serves to raise it.</p>

<p>The distribution of moisture over the surface of the continent is effected in much
the same way as is the distribution of heat. The Gulf Stream gives an abundant rainfall
to the States about the Gulf of Mexico lying to the north of that basin; its effects
on the rainfall are seen even as far north as the New England States, but they have
little effect to the west of the Mississippi River. The high mountains of the Cordilleras
cut off the Pacific winds from the centre of the continent, so that very little of
the water which flows down to the Gulf of Mexico or to the Atlantic is derived from
the Pacific. From the general conditions thus rudely outlined the following arrangement
of climates arises. The northern half of the continent is more completely
under the dominion of the Arctic Sea than any part of Europe or Asia; the only
parts of it fit for the use of civilized man are the northern watershed of the St. Lawrence,
the valley of Lake Winnipeg and the Saskatchewan, and the west-coast region
as far north as Alaska. The rest of the northern part of the continent is practically
barred out from the life of the race by the intensity of the winter cold, and by the
brevity of the summer season.</p>

<p>South of this domain of northern cold, North America divides itself, by its climate,
soil, and topographical reliefs, into the following fairly distinct regions: (1) The eastern
lowlands lying between the shore and the Appalachian range; these shade southwardly
into (2) the lowlands of the Gulf States, which is the only part of North America
in the immediate control of the Gulf Stream. These Gulf lowlands pass northwardly
into (3) the great plain of the Mississippi Valley. Between these lowlands of the
centre of the continent and the Atlantic sea-coast lie (4) the table-lands and mountains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_miv" id="Page_miv">[iv]</a></span>
of the Appalachian system. West of the Mississippi Valley lie (5) the region
of the Cordilleras of North America; and finally on the western shore we find (6) a
narrow region of low mountains, forming a slender fringe of shorelands.</p>

<p>The mountains of the Appalachian system are composed of two parallel series of
elevations, an old eastern range of peaks which are worn down to mere shreds; so
that in place of being as high as the Alps, as they once were, they have no peaks
that rise seven thousand feet above the sea. This outer range is traceable from
Newfoundland to Alabama; but it only rises above six thousand feet in the White
Mountains of New Hampshire and the Black Mountains of North Carolina. In
form these mountains are steep and rugged. Their steep sides hold the little untillable
land that exists east of the Mississippi; their actual area is small, for the chain
is very narrow, not exceeding a score or so of miles in width, except in the Carolinas
and in the White Mountains, where it is somewhat wider. The total untillable area
in this chain does not exceed twelve thousand square miles. West of this, the old
Appalachian mountain system, separated from it by a broad, elevated, somewhat
mountainous valley, lies the newer Alleghany range. This valley intermediate is one
of the most fertile and admirably situated in the world; it extends from New Jersey
to Georgia, with an average width of about forty miles and a length of about six hundred,
having an area of over twenty thousand square miles. The Alleghany Mountains
on the west are composed principally of round, symmetrical ridges, often like
gigantic works of art, so uniform are their arches; none of them rise to more than
five thousand feet above the sea, and their surfaces are so little broken that they generally
afford tillable though as yet generally untilled land. Practically no part of this
great range, which extends from near Albany to Alabama, is completely unfit for the
uses of man, and it includes some of the most fertile valleys of America. The most
important feature connected with this double mountain system of the Appalachians
is the great area of table-lands which it upholds; these bordering uplands are found
all around the mountain system. The greater part of the States of New York,
Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, the Carolinas, Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky,
and Ohio owe the considerable elevation of their surfaces to the table-land elevations
bordering the Appalachian mountain system. Taken altogether, this mountain
system is perhaps the finest region for the uses of man that the world affords; its
great length, of more than fifteen hundred miles from north to south, gives it a
range of climate such as would be had in Europe by a mountain chain extending
from Copenhagen to Rome. The total area of this Appalachian district, mountains
as well as table-lands, is about three hundred thousand square miles. This is an
area equal to near thrice the surface of Great Britain.</p>

<p>The Appalachian table-lands fade gradually into the Mississippi Valley. Their
distinct character continues to near the borders of that stream where it unites with
the Ohio. As we come upon the table-land system of the Cordilleras, soon after we
pass west of the Mississippi, this great valley may be considered as made up of the
table-lands of two great mountain systems, with only a relatively small area of alluvial
matter between the mouth of the Ohio and the Gulf. Unlike the Ganges, the Amazon,
and most other great rivers of the first class, the Mississippi River has a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mv" id="Page_mv">[v]</a></span>
delta section: not over twenty to thirty thousand square miles has this character. By
far the greater part of the basin is really table-land, and is thus free from the evil of
low countries to a degree equalled by no other very great river basin. Its valley is
characteristically a table-land valley, with a general surface of rolling plain, varying
from three hundred to five thousand feet above the level of the sea. Outside of the
Cordilleras and the Appalachians, this valley has few mountain folds within its ample
space. The absence of included mountain systems is almost as noteworthy a feature
as the small amount of delta. There are only two or three patches of mountains
that lie far beyond the limits of the great mountain systems of the east and west; and
only one of these, the Ozark Mountains of Missouri and Arkansas, is at any distance
from the main ranges. This is an insignificant group of low hills having considerable
geological but no geographical importance.</p>

<p>On the western border of the Mississippi Valley rise the vast ridges of the Cordilleras.
This great mountain region is, next after the mountainous area of Central Asia,
the most extensive region of great altitude in the world. From Mexico northward
this system of mountains widens, until, in the parallel of forty degrees, it has a width
of about one thousand miles. This system is made up of many ridges lying upon an
elevated table-land. The valleys of the lesser streams are generally over seven thousand
feet above the sea; the main peaks, to the number of many hundred, rise over
twelve thousand feet above the sea level; many of them attain to about fourteen thousand
feet of altitude. Its table-land extends east to near the Mississippi River. The
great height and width of this mountain system produce a very marked effect upon
the climate of the vast area that it incloses, and upon the country which lies within a
thousand miles to the east of its mountain walls. The winds from the Pacific are to
a great extent drained of their moisture in the western or Sierra Nevada section of
these mountains, and have little moisture to give to the central and eastern chains;
and when these winds emerge on to the western plains, they are as dry as those that
blow over the Sahara.</p>

<p>Although these Cordilleras of North America afford access by their dislocations
to a great supply of mineral substances, they are on the whole a curse to the continent.
By the cold and dryness which their height entails, they reduce one third
of the continent to sterility. Though here and there in their valleys we find oases of
fertile land, and many regions of limited area may be made fertile by the use of
irrigation, at least nineteen-twentieths of their lands are irretrievably barren. When
their resources of precious metals are exhausted, as is likely to be the case within
a hundred years, they will probably be to a great extent abandoned by man. Only
the extreme northern section and a part of the central and border lands afford any
other attractions to settlers than is found in their mineral wealth.</p>

<p>West of the Cordilleras of North America we have a narrow and mountainous
coast region that is abundantly watered by the moisture from the Pacific, which
penetrates some distance into the land over the lower ridges that border on them.
Although this belt of fertile country cannot be compared in populationsustaining
power with the Atlantic coast region, it is of great fertility, and has a climate of surpassing
excellence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mvi" id="Page_mvi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<p>On the borders of Mexico, within the limits of the United States, the mountains
sink down to much less extreme heights, and the climate becomes less strenuous.
This region is better fitted for the permanent occupation of man; but only a small
part of the land is arable,&mdash;probably not one-tenth of its surface is or ever will be
fit for the plough.</p>

<p>In Mexico proper we have a country that retains the character of the Cordilleras
so far as its general elevation is concerned, but loses the lofty ridges which we find
farther to the north. The loss of these barriers, combined with the narrowing of the
space between the Atlantic and the Pacific waters, and its more southern position,
increases the temperature and the rainfall; so that the fertility of the country augments
in a rapid way as we go southwards, until finally in the isthmic part of the
continent we have a tropical luxuriance of life. The lowland borders of the country
gain upon the width of the table-land, until south of the Tehuantepec Isthmus the
whole region is essentially unfit for the uses of our race.</p>

<p>The climate of North America south of the divide which separates the streams
flowing toward the Arctic Circle from those entering the Atlantic south of Labrador
may be said to resemble that of Europe in all important respects. The winters are
far colder; but the summer seasons, which determine the usefulness of the soil to man,
are as warm and quickening to plants as are those of the Old World. The more considerable
cold of winter is a disadvantage, inasmuch as it limits the work of agriculture
to a smaller part of the year, and requires a greater expense in the keeping of livestock.
This is a considerable evil, especially in the regions north of the parallel of
forty degrees; but the cold is not greater than in Northern Germany or in Scotland.
There can be no doubt that the body and the mind receive certain advantages from
the tonic quality of the winters which compensate for this loss.</p>

<p>Nearly the whole of North America that is within the limits of the United
States receives some share of frost. This secures it against the permanent occupation
of contagious fevers, which from time to time find their way to it from the
tropics.</p>

<p>North America, east of the 100th meridian (west of Greenwich) and north of thirty-five
degrees, has a soil which is on the whole superior to that of Europe. Practically
the whole of this vast area is tillable, and the variety of crops is very great, considerably
greater than that of Europe. West of the 100th meridian the rainfall diminishes
rapidly, being especially limited in the summer season. The winters become longer
and more extreme throughout all the region within or under the climatic influence of
the Cordilleras; the soil is thinner, and over vast regions almost wanting. In certain
exceptional tracts as far westward as the Saskatchewan, and at points along the line
between the United States and Canada to the south of that valley, there are considerable
areas of good soil; but, considered in a general way, we may exclude all the
region between the 100th meridian and the Sierra Nevada range from the hope of
any great agricultural future. Even should the rainfall be increased by tree-planting
in those regions where trees may grow, the quality of the soil in this district, even
where soil exists, is often too poor for any use. Yet in some parts it is very good,
and if tree-planting should increase the rainfall, some limited areas will be tillable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mvii" id="Page_mvii">[vii]</a></span></p>

<p>Next to the quality of the soil, the forest covering of a country does the most to
determine its uses to man. Although the Western prairies have the temporary advantage
that they are more readily brought under cultivation than wooded regions, the
forests of a land contribute so largely to man’s well-being, that without them he can
hardly maintain the structure of his civilization. The distribution of American forests
is peculiar. All the Appalachian mountain system and the shore region between that
system and the sea, as well as the Gulf border as far west as the Mississippi, were
originally covered by the finest forest that has existed in the historical period, outside
of the tropics. In the highlands south of Pennsylvania and in the western table-land
north to the Great Lakes, this forest was generally of hard-wood or deciduous trees; on
the shore-land and north of Pennsylvania in the highlands, the pines and other conifers
held a larger share of the surface. The parts of the land bordering the Mississippi
on the west, as far as the central regions of Louisiana, Arkansas, and Missouri, are
forest clad. Michigan and portions of Wisconsin and Minnesota have broad areas
of forests, but the cis-Mississippian States of Indiana and Illinois, and the trans-Mississippian
country west to the Sierra Nevada, is only wooded, and that generally
scantily, along the borders of the streams. Data for precise statements are yet
wanting, but there is no doubt that this area is untimbered over about seven eighths
of its surface, and the wood which exists has a relatively small value for constructive
purposes. North of the regions described, except along the Pacific coast, where fine
soft-wood forests extend from near San Francisco to Alaska, the forest growth rapidly
diminishes in size, and therefore in value, the trees becoming short and gnarled,
and the kinds of wood inferior. So that the region north of the St. Lawrence and
of the Great Lakes is not to be regarded as having any very great value from the
forest resources it affords. In estimating the value of North America to man, the
limitation of good forests to the region east of the Mississippi must be regarded as
a disadvantage which is likely to become more serious with the advance of time.
Undoubtedly the timberless character of the prairie country for at least two hundred
miles west of the Mississippi is in the main due to the constant burning over
of the surface by the aborigines. It seems possible that these regions may yet be
made to bear extensive woods. The elevated plains that lie farther to the west
seem to have too little rainfall for the support of forests.</p>

<p>The rivers of a country are a result and a measure of its climate. The generally
large rainfall of the eastern half of North America is shown by the number and
size of its streams, which, area for area, are longer and more frequent than those of
the Old World, except on the eastern coast of Asia. The heaviest rainfall and the
greatest average of streams is found about the Gulf of Mexico and the southern part
of the Appalachian district. Hence, northerly, westerly, and northwesterly, the rainfall
decreases in amount. The average of the region east of the Mississippi and south
of the Laurentian Mountains is probably about fifty inches per annum, somewhere
near one-third more than that of Europe. North America, despite the very dry district
of the Cordilleras, has an average rainfall about as great as that of Europe, and
probably rather greater than Asia; indeed its water-supply is rather greater than the
average for lands situated so far from the equator.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mviii" id="Page_mviii">[viii]</a></span></p>

<p>The rivers of America have been of very great importance in the settlement of the
land. They afford more navigable waters than all the streams of Asia put together.
Without the system of the Mississippi, which has more navigable waters than any
river except the Amazons, it would not have been possible for America to have
been brought under the control of colonies with such speed.</p>

<p>The elevation of the surface of North America, at least of its more habitable
portions, is very favorable to man. A large part of its fertile soils lie from five hundred
to fifteen hundred feet above the sea. It has a larger part of its surface within
the limits of height that are best suited to the uses of man than Asia, but less than
Europe has.</p>

<p>In considering the fitness of this continent for the use of European races, it will
not do to overlook the mineral resources of the country. It may be stated in general
terms that North America is richer in the mineral substances which have most contributed
to the development of man than any other continent. The precious metals
may be briefly dismissed. They occur constantly in two areas: the Cordilleran,&mdash;which,
from Mexico, California, Nevada, New Mexico, and Colorado, has doubtless
furnished more gold and silver than any other one mountain district,&mdash;and the
Appalachian region, which has given about sixty million dollars to the world’s store of
gold. The precious mineral resources of the Cordilleran region are probably greater
than those of any other continent. They have already exercised a very great influence
on the commercial and political history of the continent, and are likely to become of
more importance as time goes on, for at least half a century to come.</p>

<p>In the so-called baser, yet really more precious, metals this continent is even more
fortunate. The supplies in the most important metal, iron, are very great,&mdash;certainly
greater than in Europe. This metal is distributed with much uniformity over the
country, there being scarcely a State except Florida that cannot claim some share of
this metal. Especially rich in deposits of this metal are the States which share the
Appalachian district, and the States of Missouri and Michigan. The Rocky Mountains
also abound in iron ores, which there often contain a certain proportion of the
precious metals; so that it is possible that the exploitation of the two metals may in
time be carried on there together. There is probably no other continent that contains
as large a share of iron,&mdash;the most important metal for the uses of man.</p>

<p>The other less used, but still commercially important, metals,&mdash;zinc, lead, and
copper,&mdash;are found in considerable abundance in the Appalachian, the Laurentian,
and the Cordilleran regions, especially in the last-named district. The only metal that
is rarely found in North America, never yet in quantities of economic importance, is
tin. Some specimens of bronze implements have been found in Mexico and Peru.
They seem to afford the only evidence that the aboriginal peoples knew how to smelt
any metals. Though the natives in the more northern districts used copper, they
never discovered the art of smelting it.</p>

<p>Considering the useful metals as a whole, North America is proportionally richer
than any other country that is well known to us.</p>

<p>The most considerable of the resources that the rocks of America offer, are found
in the deposits of coal which they contain. These deposits are of vast extent, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mix" id="Page_mix">[ix]</a></span>
are excellently fitted for the various uses of this fuel. While the other mineral resources
of the country are most abundant in the region of the Cordilleras, the best
of these deposits of coal are accumulated in and about the Appalachian district.
At least nine tenths of the coal of America lies to the east of the Mississippi
River. New England, New York, South Carolina, Florida, Mississippi, and Louisiana
are the only States that are practically without coal; and even in New England,
Rhode Island and the neighboring parts of Massachusetts have promising but
essentially undeveloped fields. In the Cordilleran district coal deposits of small
area occur; but the material is generally of poor quality, and is not likely to have a
great utility.</p>

<p>As a whole, the resources in the way of subterranean fuel are far richer on this
continent than in Europe. The area of coal-bearing rocks is at least eight times as
great, and the deposits are much better disposed for working. No other continent
save Asia is likely to develop anything like these coal resources; in China the coal
area seems much larger than that of North America, but the richness of the field
has not yet been fully proven: it is, however, undoubtedly great.</p>

<p>As the latent power of any modern society depends in an intimate way upon
the buried stores of solar energy in coal-beds, the large area and good quality of the
American coal-fields are very important advantages, and are full of promise for the
economic future of its people.</p>

<p>Among the less important resources of the rocks in North America are the various
classes of coal-oils which were first brought into commerce from its fields. Although
these oils are not peculiar to North America, the small amount of disruption which
its rocks have undergone have caused them to be retained in the subterranean store-houses;
while in other countries, where the rocks have been more disturbed, these
oils have been allowed to escape to the streams or the air. The areas where these
oils occur on the continent are widely scattered. They are, however, principally
confined to the Upper Ohio Valley; they are known to exist also in the Valley of the
Cumberland River, in California, and in Western Canada north of Lake Erie. Besides
these flowing oils there are immense areas of black shales, which yield large
quantities of oil to distillation. These are not now of value, on account of the abundance
of these flowing oils; but as in the immediate future these flowing wells are likely
to cease their production, we may look to these shales for an almost indefinite supply
of oil. In the Ohio Valley, extending eastward in Virginia into the valleys of the
Atlantic streams, there is an area of over one hundred thousand square miles of this
shale, which is on the average over one hundred and fifty feet thick, and yields about
ten per cent of oil. In other words, it is equal to a lake of oil as large as New York
and Pennsylvania, and fifteen feet deep,&mdash;a practically unlimited source of this
material.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the sources of supply of phosphate and alkaline marls
are very large. As these substances are subject to a constant waste in agriculture, and
are the most important of all materials to the growth of the standard crops, the soil
of America promises on the whole to be as enduring as is that of Europe, though,
owing to the larger rainfall, it tends to waste away more rapidly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mx" id="Page_mx">[x]</a></span></p>

<p>The building stones of a country are of importance, inasmuch as they affect the
constructions of a people; in such materials, suited for the purposes of simple strength
and durability, the country is very well supplied, being quite as well off as Europe.
On the other hand, the stones that lend themselves to the more decorative uses, the
pure white or variegated marbles, are not nearly as rich as the countries about the
Mediterranean, which is of all known regions the richest in decorative stones.</p>

<p>It is not possible within the limits of this chapter to support by sufficient details
the foregoing statements concerning the physical conditions of America. The necessary
brevity of the work has made it difficult to find place for all the points that
should be presented; it may be fairly said, however, that the statements as made are
to a very great extent matters of general information, which lie beyond the scope of
debate, being well known to all students of American physiography.</p>

<p>Accepting the foregoing statements as true, it may be fairly owned that the general
physical conditions of the American continent closely resemble those of Europe, and
that in all the more important matters our race gained rather than lost by its transfer
from the Old World to the New.</p>

<h3><span class="font1 large">Part II.</span></h3>

<p class="pc1 lmid">EFFECT OF THE PHYSIOGRAPHY OF NORTH AMERICA ON MEN
OF EUROPEAN ORIGIN.</p>

<p class="p2">In their organic life the continents of America have always stood somewhat apart
from those of the Old World. This isolation is marked in every stage of their geological
history. In each geological period they have many forms that never found
their way to the other lands, and we fail to find there many species that are abundant
in the continents of the Old World.</p>

<p>The same causes that kept the animal and vegetable life of the Americas distinct
from Europe and Asia have served to keep those continents apart from the human
history of the Old World. Something more than the relations that are patent on a
map are necessary to a proper understanding of the long continued isolation of these
continents.</p>

<p>In the first place, we may notice the fact that from the Old World the most approachable
side of these continents lies on the west. Not only are the lands of the
New and Old World there brought into close relations to each other, but the ocean
streams of the North Pacific flow toward America. Moreover the North Pacific is a
sea of a calmer temper than the North Atlantic, and the chance farers over its surface
would be more likely to survive its perils. In the North Atlantic, over which alone
the Aryan peoples could well have found their way to America, we have a wide sea,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mxi" id="Page_mxi">[xi]</a></span>
which is not only the stormiest in the world, but its currents set strongly against
western-going ships, and the prevailing winds blow from the west.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> If it had been
intended that America should long remain unknown to the seafaring peoples of
Semitic or Aryan race, it would not have been easy, within the compass of earthly
conditions, to accomplish it in a more effective manner than it has been done by
the present geography.</p>

<p>The result is that man, who doubtless originated in the Old World, early found
his way to America by the Pacific; and all the so-called indigenous races known
to us in the Americas seem to have closer relations to the peoples living in northern
Asia than to those of any other country. It is pretty clear that none of the
aboriginal American peoples have found their way to these continents by way of
the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Although the access to the continent of North America is much more easily had
upon its western side, and though all the early settlements were probably made that
way, the configuration of the land is such that it is not possible to get easy access to
the heart of the continent from the Pacific shore. So that although the Atlantic Ocean
was most forbidding and difficult as a way to America, once passed, it gave the freest
and best access to the body of the continent. In the west, the Cordilleras are a formidable
bar to those who seek to enter the continent from the Pacific. None but a
modern civilization would ever have forced its barriers of mountains and of deserts.
An ancient civilization, if it had penetrated America from the west, would have recoiled
from the labor of traversing this mountain system, that combines the difficulties of the
Alps and the Sahara. If European emigration had found such a mountain system on
the eastern face of the continent, the history of America would have been very different.
Scarcely any other continent offers such easy ingress as does this continent to
those who come to it from the Atlantic side. The valleys of the St. Lawrence, the Hudson,
the Mississippi, in a fashion also of the Susquehanna and the James, break through
or pass around the low-coast mountains, and afford free ways into the whole of the
interior that is attractive to European peoples. No part of the Alleghanian system
presents any insuperable obstacles to those who seek to penetrate the inner lands.
The whole of its surface is fit for human uses; there are neither deserts of sand nor of
snow. The axe alone would open ways readily passable to men and horses. So that
when the early settlers had passed the sea, all their formidable geographical difficulties
were at an end,&mdash;with but little further toil the wide land lay open to them. I propose
in the subsequent pages to give a sketch of the physical conditions of this continent,
with reference to the transplanted civilization that has developed upon its soil.
It will be impossible, within the limits of this essay, to do more than indicate these
conditions in a very general way, for the details of the subject would constitute a work
in itself. It will be most profitable for us first to glance at the general relations of
climate and soil that are found in North America, so far as these features bear upon
the history of the immigration it has received from Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mxii" id="Page_mxii">[xii]</a></span></p>

<p>The climate of North America south of the Laurentian Mountains and east of the
Rocky Mountains is much more like that of Europe than of any we find in the other
continents. Although there are many points of difference, these variations lie well
within the climatic range of Europe itself. On the south, Mexico may well be compared
to Italy and Spain; in the southern parts of the Mississippi Valley we have conditions
in general comparable to those of Lombardy and Central France; and in the
northern portions of that area and along the sea-border we can find fair parallels for
the conditions of Great Britain, Germany, or Scandinavia. As is well known, the
range of temperature during the year varies much more in America than in Europe,
but these variations in themselves are of small importance. Man in a direct way is not
much affected by temperature; his elastic body, helped by his arts, may within certain
limits neglect this element of climate. The real question is how far these temperatures
affect the products of the soil upon which his civilization depends. In the case
of most plants and domestic animals, their development depends more upon the summer
temperature, or that of the spring season, than upon the winter climate. Now
the summer climates of America are more like those of Europe than are those of the
winter. So the new-won continent offered to man a chance to rear all the plants and
animals which he had brought to domesticity in the Old World.</p>

<p>The general character of the soil of North America is closely comparable with
that of Europe, yet it has certain noteworthy peculiarities. In the first place, there
is a larger part of America which has been subjected to glacial action than what we
find in Europe. In Europe, only the northern half of Great Britain, the Scandinavian
peninsulas, a part of Northern Germany, and the region of Switzerland were under
the surface of the glaciers during the last glacial period. In America, practically all
the country north of the Susquehanna, and more than half of the States north of the
Ohio, had their soils influenced by this ice period. The effects of glaciation on the
soils of the region where it has acted are important. In the first place, the soils thus
produced are generally clayey and of a rather stubborn nature, demanding much care
and labor to bring them into a shape for the plough. The surface is usually thickly
covered with stones, which have to be removed before the plough can be driven. I
have estimated that not less than an average of thirty days’ labor has been given to
each acre of New England soil to put it into arable condition after the forest has been
removed; nearly as much labor has to be given to removing the forest and undergrowth:
so that each cultivated acre in this glacial region requires about two months’
labor before it is in shape for effective tillage.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> When so prepared, the soils of glaciated
districts are of a very even fertility. They hold the same character over wide
areas, and their constitution is the same to great depths. Though never of the highest
order of fertility, they remain for centuries constant in their power. I have never seen
a worn-out field of this sort. Another peculiarity of the American soils is the relatively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mxiii" id="Page_mxiii">[xiii]</a></span>
large area of limestone lands which the country affords. America abounds in deposits
of this nature, which produce soils of the first quality, extremely well fitted to the production
of grass and grains. Although statistical information is not to be obtained
on such a matter, I have no doubt, after a pretty close scrutiny of both America and
Europe, that the original fertility of America was greater than that of Europe; but
that, on the whole, the regions first settled by Europeans were much more difficult
to subdue than the best lands of Central and Southern Europe had been.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The foregoing statement needs the following qualification: Owing to the relative
dryness and heat of the American summer, the forests are not so swampy as they are
in Northern Europe, and morasses are generally absent. It required many centuries
of continued labor to bring the surface of Northern Germany, Northern France, and
of Britain into conditions fit for tillage.</p>

<p>Next to deserts and snowy mountains, swamps are the greatest barriers to the
movements of man. If the reader will follow the interesting account of the Saxon
Conquest given in Mr. Green’s volume on <i>The Making of England</i>, he will see how
the tracts of marsh and marshy forest served for many centuries to limit the work
of subjugation. In America there are no extensive bogs or wet forests in the upland
district, south of the St. Lawrence, except in Maine and in the British Provinces. In
all other districts fire or the axe can easily bring the surface into a shape fit for cultivation.
In taking an account of the physical conditions which formed the subjugation
of North America by European colonies, we must give a large place to this absence of
upland swamps and the dryness of the forests, which prevented the growth of peaty
matter within their bounds.</p>

<p>The success of the first settlements in America was also greatly aided by the fact
that the continent afforded them a new and cheaper source of bread, in the maize or
Indian corn which was everywhere used by the aborigines of America. It is difficult to
convey an adequate impression of the importance of this grain in the early history of
America. In the first place, it yields not less than twice the amount of food per acre
of tilled land, with much less labor than is required for an acre of small grains; it is
far less dependent on the changes of seasons; the yield is much more uniform than
that of the old European grains; the harvest need not be made at such a particular
season; the crops may with little loss be allowed to remain ungathered for weeks after
the grain is ripe; the stalks of the grain need not be touched in the harvesting, the
ears alone being gathered; these stalks are of greater value for forage than is the straw
of wheat and other similar grains. Probably the greatest advantage of all that this
beneficent plant afforded to the early settlers was the way in which it could be planted
without ploughing, amid the standing forest trees which had only been deadened by
having their bark stripped away by the axe. This rough method of tillage was unknown
among the peoples of the Old World. None of their cultivated plants were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mxiv" id="Page_mxiv">[xiv]</a></span>
suited to it; but the maize admitted of such rude tillage. The aborigines, with no
other implements than stone axes and a sort of spade armed also with stone, would
kill the forest trees by girdling or cutting away a strip around the bark. This admitted
the light to the soil. Then breaking up patches of earth, they planted the grains of
maize among the standing trees; its strong roots readily penetrated deep into the
soil, and the strong tops fought their way to the light with a vigor which few plants
possess. The grain was ready for domestic use within three months from the time
of planting, and in four months it was ready for the harvest.</p>

<p>The beginnings in civilization which the aborigines of this country had made, rested
on this crop and on the pumpkin, which seems to have been cultivated with it by
the savages, as it still is by those who inherited their lands and their methods of
tillage. The European colonists almost everywhere and at once adopted this crop
and the method of tillage which the Indians used. Maize-fields, with pumpkin-vines
in the interspaces of the plants, became for many years the prevailing, indeed almost
the only, crop throughout the northern part of America. It is hardly too much to
say, that, but for these American plants and the American method of tilling them,
it would have been decidedly more difficult to have fixed the early colonies on
this shore.</p>

<p>Another American plant has had an important influence on the history of American
commerce, though it did not aid in the settlement of the country,&mdash;tobacco. That
singular gift of the New World to the Old quickly gave the basis of a great export to
the colonies of Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina; it alone enabled the agriculture
of the Southern colonies to outgrow in wealth those which were planted in more
northern soil. To this crop, which demands much manual labor of an unskilled kind,
and rewards it well, we owe the rapid development of African slavery. It is doubtful
if this system of slavery would ever have flourished if America had been limited
in its crops to those plants which the settlers brought from the Old World. Although
African slavery existed for a time in the States north of the tobacco region, it died
away in them even before the humanitarian sentiments of modern times could have
aided in its destruction; it was the profitable nature of tobacco crops which fixed this
institution on our soil, as it was the great extension of cotton culture which made this
system take on its overpowering growth during the first decades of the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p>Another interesting effect of the conditions of tillage which met the early settlers
upon this soil depends upon the peculiar distribution of forests in North America. All
those regions which were first occupied by European peoples were covered by very
dense forests. To clear these woods away required not less than thirty days’ labor to
each acre of land. In the glaciated districts, as before remarked, this labor of preparation
was nearly doubled. The result was that the area of tillage only slowly expanded
as the population grew denser, and the surplusage of grain for export was small during
the first two centuries. When in the nineteenth century the progress westward suddenly
brought the people upon the open lands of the prairies, the extension of tillage
went on with far greater celerity. We are now in the midst of the great revolution
that these easily won and very fertile lands are making in the affairs of the world.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mxv" id="Page_mxv">[xv]</a></span>
For the first time in human history, a highly skilled people have suddenly come into
possession of a vast and fertile area which stands ready for tillage without the labor
that is necessary to prepare forest lands for the plough. They are thus able to flood
the grain-markets of the world with food derived from lands which represent no other
labor beyond tillage except that involved in constructing railways for the exportation
of their products. This enables the people of the Western plains to compete with
countries where the land represents a great expenditure of labor in overcoming the
natural barriers to the cultivation of the soil.</p>

<p>There are many lesser peculiarities connected with the soils of North America that
have had considerable influence upon the history of the people; the most essential
fact is, however, that the climatic conditions of this continent are such that all the
important European products, except the olive, will flourish over a wide part of its
surface. So that the peoples who come to it from any part of Europe find a climate
not essentially different from their own, where the plants and animals on which their
civilization rested would flourish as well as in their own home.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>We may note also that the climate of North America brought Europeans in contact
with no new diseases. North of the Gulf of Mexico the maladies of man were
not increased by the transportation from Europe. It is difficult to arrive at a satisfactory
determination concerning the effect of American conditions upon the peoples
who have come from Europe to live a life of many generations upon its soil. Much
has been said in a desultory way upon this subject, but little that has any very clear
scientific value. The problem is a very complicated one. In the first place it is very
difficult, if not impossible, to separate the effects of climate from those brought about
by a diversity of the social conditions, such as habits of labor, of food, etc. Moreover,
the problem is further complicated by the fact that there has been a constant influx of
folk into America from various parts of Europe, so that in most parts of the country
there has been a constant admixture of the old blood and the new.</p>

<p>After reviewing the sources of information, I am convinced that the following
facts may be regarded as established: The American people are no smaller in size
than are the peoples in Europe from which they are derived; they are at least as long-lived;
their capacity to withstand fatigue, wounds, etc. is at least as great as that of
any European people; the average of physical beauty is probably quite as good as it
is among an equal population in the Old World; the fecundity of the people is not
diminished. The compass of this essay will not permit me to enter into the details
necessary to defend these propositions as they might be defended. I will, however,
show certain facts which seem to support them. First, as regards the physical proportions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mxvi" id="Page_mxvi">[xvi]</a></span>
of the American people. By far the largest collections of accurate measurements
that have ever been made of men were made by the officers of the United States
Sanitary Commission during the late Civil War. These statistics have been carefully
tabulated by Dr. B. A. Gould, the distinguished astronomer. From the results
reached by him, it is plain that the average dimensions of these troops were as good
as those of any European army; while the men from those States where the population
had been longest separated from the mother country were on the whole the
best formed of all.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The statistics of the life-insurance companies make it clear that the death-rate is
not higher in America among the classes that insure than in England. I am credibly
informed that American companies expect a longer life among their clients than the
English tables of mortality assume.</p>

<p>The endurance of fatigue and wounds in armies has been proved by our Civil War
to be as good as that of the best English or Continental troops. Such forced marches
as that of Buell to the relief of the overwhelmed troops at Pittsburg Landing, or Shiloh,&mdash;where
the men marched thirty-five miles without rest, and at once entered upon a
contest which checked a victorious army,&mdash;is proof enough of the physical and moral
endurance of the people. The extraordinary percentage of seriously wounded men
that recovered during this war,&mdash;a proportion without parallel in European armies,&mdash;can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mxvii" id="Page_mxvii">[xvii]</a></span>
only be attributed to the innate vigor of the men, and not to any superiority in the
treatment they received. The distinguished physiologist, Dr. Brown-Séquard, assures
me that the American body, be it that of man or beast, is more enduring of wounds
than the European; that to make a given impression upon the body of a creature in
America it is necessary to inflict severer wounds than it would be to produce the same
effect on a creature of the same species in Europe. His opportunities for forming
an opinion on this subject have been singularly great, so that the assertion seems to
me very important. That the fecundity of the population is not on the whole diminishing,
is sufficiently shown by the statistics of the country. In the matter of physical
beauty, the condition of the American people cannot, of course, be made a matter of
statistics. The testimony of all intelligent travellers is to the effect that the forms of
the people have lost nothing of their distinguished inheritance of beauty from their
ancestors. The face is certainly no less intellectual in its type than that of the Teutonic
peoples of the Old World, while the body is, though perhaps of a less massive
mould, without evident marks of less symmetry.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best assurance we obtain concerning the fitness of North America for
the long-continued residence of Teutonic people may be derived from the consideration
of the history of the two American settlements that have remained for about two
hundred years without considerable admixture of new European blood. These are the
English settlement in Virginia and the French in the region of the St. Lawrence; both
these populations have been upon the soil for about two hundred years, with but little
addition from their mother countries. In Virginia, essentially the whole of the white
blood is English; the only mixture of any moment is from the Pennsylvania Germans,
a people of kindred race, and equally long upon the soil. I believe that not less than
ninety-five per cent of the white blood,&mdash;if I may be allowed this form of expression,&mdash;is
derived from British soil. We have no statistics concerning the bodily condition of
the Virginian people which will enable us to compare them with those of other States.
The few recruits in the Federal army who were measured by the Sanitary Commission
were mainly from the poorer classes, the oppressed “poor whites,” and are not a fair
index of the physical condition of the people of this State. We have only the fact
that the Confederate army of northern Virginia, composed in the main of the small
farmers of the commonwealth, fought, under Lee and Jackson, a long, stubborn, losing
fight, as well as any other men of the race have done. No other test of vigor is so
perfect as that which such a struggle gives. Where a people make such men as
Jackson, and such men as made Jackson’s career possible, we may be sure that they
are not in their decadence.</p>

<p>In Kentucky and Tennessee we have little else than Virginia blood and that of
northwestern Carolina, which was derived from Virginia, with the exception of the
very localized German settlements along the Ohio River: practically the whole of the
white agricultural population of these States is of British blood that has been on this
soil for about two hundred years. I do not believe there is any other body of folk of
as purely English stock as this white population of Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee:
it amounts to almost three millions of people, and there is scarcely any admixture of
other blood. In Virginia, as before remarked, there are no statistics to show just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mxviii" id="Page_mxviii">[xviii]</a></span>
what the physical conditions of the population are; but in Kentucky and Tennessee
a large number of men who were born upon the soil were measured by the Sanitary
Commission. The results were as follows: the troops from Kentucky and Tennessee
were larger than those from any other State; in height, girth of chest, and size of head,
they were of remarkable proportions. The men of no European army exceed them
in size, though some picked bodies of troops are equally large. We must remember
also that these men were not selected from the body of the people, as European
armies are, but that they represent the State in arms, very few being rejected for disability.
We must also remember that the men from the most fertile parts of these
States, those parts which have the reputation of breeding the largest men, went into
the Confederate army; while the Union troops were principally recruited from the
poorer districts, where the people suffer somewhat from the want of sufficient variety
in their food. The fighting quality of these men is well shown by the history of a
Kentucky brigade in the Confederate army in the campaign near Atlanta in 1864, in
which the brigade, during four months of very active service, received more wounds
than it had men, and not over ten men were unaccounted for at the end of the
campaign.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The goodness of this service is probably not exceptional; it has for us,
however, the especial interest that these men were the product of six generations of
American life,&mdash;showing as well as possible that the physical and moral conditions
of life upon this continent are not calculated to depreciate the important inheritances
of the race.</p>

<p>Although it is only a part of the problem, it is well to notice that the death-rate in
these States of old American blood is singularly low, and the number of very aged
people who retain their faculties to an advanced age very great. The census of 1870
gave the death-rate of Kentucky at about eleven in a thousand,&mdash;a number small
almost beyond belief. It should also be noticed that the emigration from Kentucky
has for fifty years or more been very large, relatively almost as heavy as that from
Massachusetts. It is a well-known fact, which is made most evident by the statistics
of the Sanitary Commission above referred to, that the larger and stronger citizens
of a State are more apt to emigrate than those of weaker frame, the result being
that the population left behind is deprived of its most vigorous blood.</p>

<p>The Canadian-French population presents us with another instance in which a
European people long upon the soil, and without recent additions of blood from the
native country, have maintained themselves unharmed amid conditions of considerable
difficulty. This French population has been upon the soil for about as long as that of
Virginia; that is to say, for two centuries and more. I have been unable to find any
statistics concerning the numbers brought as colonists to America. I have questioned
various students on this matter, and have come to the conclusion that the original number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mxix" id="Page_mxix">[mxix]</a></span>
did not exceed twenty-five thousand souls. This people has not perceptibly intermingled
with those of other blood, so that its separate career can be traced with less
difficulty than that of any other people. Race-hatreds, differences of language, of
religion, and of customs have kept them apart from their neighbors in a fashion that
is more European than American. This has been a great disadvantage to the race,
for they have remained in a state of subordination as great as that in which the Africans
of the Southern States now are. No other folk of European origin within the
British Empire have remained so burdened by disabilities of all kinds as this remarkable
people. The soil with which they have to deal is much more difficult than the average
of America; most of it lies beyond the limits where Indian corn will grow, and
much of it will scarcely nourish the hardier small grains. Despite the material difficulties
of their position, their general illiteracy and intensified provincialism, this people
have shown some very vigorous qualities; they have more than doubled in numbers in
each generation; they are vigorous, exceedingly industrious, and have much mechanical
tact. In New England they hold their own in the struggle with the native, so that
it seems likely that the States of that district may soon be in good part peopled by the
folk of this race. As near as I can ascertain, these Canadian-French of pure blood in
Canada and the United States amount to about two and a half millions; if this be
the case, the population has more than doubled each thirty years since their arrival
upon American soil,&mdash;which is about as rapid a rate of increase as can be found among
any people in the world, perhaps only surpassed by the population of Virginia; which
commonwealth, starting with an original English emigration which could not have exceeded
one hundred thousand, counts at the present day not less than six million
descendants, or about twice as many as there would be if each generation only doubled
the numbers of the preceding.</p>

<p>There is yet another separate people on the American soil which has been here
for about six generations without any addition from abroad: these are the so-called
Pennsylvanian Germans. I shall not take time to do more than mention them, for
they, without recent European admixture, show the same evidences of continued vigor
that is presented by the Virginian British and the Canadian French blood. Their progeny
are to be counted by millions; and though they, like the Canadian French, have
shown as yet little evidence of intellectual capacity, this may be explained by the
extreme isolation that their language and customs have forced upon them.</p>

<p>Imperfectly as I have been able to present this important series of facts, it is
enough to make it clear that they are mistaken who think that the recent emigrations
from Europe have helped to maintain the vigor of the American people. It seems
more likely that, so far from adding to the strength of the older stocks, the newer
comers, mostly of a lower kind of folk than the original settlers, have served rather
to hinder than to help the progress of the population which came with the original
colonies.</p>

<p>These considerations may be extended, by those who care to do so, by a study of
several other isolated peoples in this country,&mdash;the German colonies of Texas, the
Swiss of Tennessee, and several others; all of which have prospered, and all of which
have gone to prove that the climate of North America is singularly well fitted for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mxx" id="Page_mxx">[xx]</a></span>
use of Northern Europeans. No sufficiently large colonies of Italians, Spanish, or
Portuguese have ever been planted within the limits of the present United States to
determine the fitness of its conditions for the peoples of those States. There is no
reason, however, to believe that they would not have succeeded on this soil if fortune
had brought them here.</p>

<p>It is worth while to notice the fact that the European domesticated animals have
without exception prospered on American soil. The seven really domesticated mammals
and the half-dozen birds of our barnyards have remained essentially unchanged
in their proportions, longevity, and fitness for the uses of man. As there can be no
moral influences bearing upon these creatures, they afford a strong proof of the essential
identity of the physical conditions of the two continents. Evidence of the same
sort, though less complete, is afforded by the history of European domesticated plants
on our soil. Speaking generally, we may say that with trifling exceptions they all do as
well or better here than on their own ground. With the same care, wheat, rye, oats,
barley, etc., give the same returns as in their native countries.</p>

<p>Imperfect as this <i>résumé</i> is, it will make it clear that we are justified in believing
that the climate and other physical conditions of central North America is as favorable
to the development of men and animals of European races as their own country.
Those who would see how important this point is to the history of our race should
consider the fact that the empire of India has proved utterly unfit for the uses of
Europeans, though other branches of the Aryan race have attained a high degree
of development within its limits.</p>

<p class="p2">I next propose to consider the especial physical features of the continent with
reference to several settlements that were made upon it, the extent to which the
geography and the local conditions of soil, climate, etc. have affected the fate of the
several colonies planted on the eastern shore of North America north of Mexico.</p>

<p>Chance rather than choice determined the position of the several colonies that
were planted on the American soil. So little was known of the natural conditions of
the continent, or even of its shore geography, and the little that had been discovered
was so unknown to navigators in general, that it was not possible to exercise much discretion
in the placing of the first settlers in the New World. It happened that in this
lottery the central parts of the American continent fell to the English people; while the
French, by one chance and another, came into possession of two parts of the coast
separated by over two thousand miles of shore. It will be plain from the map that
these two positions were essentially the keys to the continent. The access to the interior
of the continent by natural water-ways is by two lines,&mdash;on the north by the St.
Lawrence system of lakes and rivers; on the south by the Mississippi system of rivers,
which practically connects with the St. Lawrence system. Fortune, in giving France
the control of these two great avenues, offered her the mastery of the whole of its vast
domain. We have only to consider the part that the pathway of the Rhine played
in the history of mediæval trade in Europe, to understand how valuable these lines
would have been until railways and canals had come to compete with water-ways-.</p>

<p>The only long-continued and systematic effort that France made to perpetuate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mxxi" id="Page_mxxi">[xxi]</a></span>
her power in North America was made through the Valley of the St. Lawrence. Let
us, therefore, consider the physical conditions of this valley, and their influence upon
the colonies that were planted there. The St. Lawrence River system and the valley
it drains is most peculiar. It is, indeed, without its like in all the world. At the
mouth of the main river we have a set of rugged islands and peninsulas enclosing an
estuarine sea, the Gulf of St. Lawrence, which gradually narrows in the course of
three hundred miles to the channel of the great river. Ascending this river, the
early explorers found a wonderful set of rapids; then a lake larger than any sheet of
fresh water that had been seen by Europeans; then the swift channel of the Niagara
River with its great Falls; then, above, a series of four great lakes, giving a real Mediterranean
of fresh water. On the north was a rude and unpromising country, rising
upward into low but sterile and rugged mountains; but on the south the natural
boundaries of the valley about the Great Lakes hardly exist: indeed, it was possible
in the time of rains for small boats to pass directly from Lake Michigan to the waters
of the Mississippi without a portage. It is this absence of the southern bounding wall
which constitutes the most peculiar feature in this region of geographical surprises.</p>

<p>Viewed on the map, this system of waters seems to afford the natural avenue to
the heart of the continent; and when its geography became known, we may well imagine
that the French believed that they had here the way to secure their dominion
over it. Not only did it afford a convenient water-way to the heart of the continent,
but also, by way of Lake Champlain, an easy access to the rear of the New-England
settlements and to the Hudson. Thus it not only flanked and turned the English
settlements of the whole continent, but it made the New-England position appear
almost untenable.</p>

<p>Experience, however, showed that there were certain grave disadvantages attending
the navigation of these waters. The river itself is not readily accessible to large
vessels beyond the tidal belt. Its rapids and the Falls of Niagara are very great
obstacles to its use,&mdash;barriers which were never overcome during the French occupation
of the country. The Great Lakes are stormy seas, with scarcely a natural
harbor, requiring for their navigation even more seamanship than do the open waters
of the Atlantic. Moreover, these channels are frozen for five months in the year,
so that all movements made by them are limited to about half the year.</p>

<p>Despite these disadvantages, the St. Lawrence system doubtless gave the French
a vast advantage in the race for empire on this continent. When we consider
that for a long time they had the control of the Mississippi as well, it seems surprising
that their power was ever broken. The facilities which this water system gave to
military movements that took the whole of the English colonies in the rear was
not the sole advantage it afforded its first European possessors; though, on the other
hand, it must be remembered that the strategic movements of the English were
on interior lines, if largely indeed without water-ways. It was the key to the best
of the fur-trade country, and to the best fisheries in America. For the first hundred
years after the settlement of this country, furs and fish were the only exports of value
from the region north of Maryland. The French settlements gave them control of
the best fishery grounds, as also the trade with the Indians, who occupied the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mxxii" id="Page_mxxii">[xxii]</a></span>
country for peltries in the world. As soon as the English came to possess it, this trade
was greatly developed. Along with these advantages, the country had many evils that
made the beginnings of colonies a matter of great labor and difficulty. The soil is
made up of drift, and requires a great amount of labor to fit it for tillage. The greater
part of it is north of the maize belt, so that this cheap and highly nutritious food was
denied to the people. I have already said something concerning the singular advantages
that this grain had for the pioneer in the American forests. I am inclined to
believe that the want of this plant in the French colonies was one cause of their slow
development. Another hindrance lay in the very long and severe winters. This
limited the time which could be given to the tillage of land, and made the keeping of
domesticated animals a matter of great difficulty. Something, too, must be attributed
to the character of the colonists and to the nature of the land-tenure in this region.
Their system of immigration gave a smaller proportion of natural leaders to the people,
so that the colony always remained in a closer dependence on the mother country.
There was always an absence of the initiative power which so marked the English colonies.
The seigniorial systems of Europe have never prospered in America, and the
early experiments in founding colonies by the mere exportation of men to this soil were
failures even when the men were of English blood. The efforts to colonize the seaboard
region of North Carolina without giving the fee of the land to the people,
and without care in the selection of the colonists, resulted in a failure even more
complete than that of the Canadian colonies. The Pamlico-Sound settlements
showed so little military power that they were incapable of protecting themselves
against the savages of the country, and without the help of Virginia they would
have been annihilated. The French-Canadian colonists have always showed this
incapacity to act for themselves, which cannot be attributed to physical conditions.
As compared with the New-England colonists, with whom they came most in contact,
they represented a colonizing scheme based on trading-posts; while their neighbors
established and fought for homes in the English sense. The struggle for existence
was in the English settler met with a vigor which grew out of political and religious
convictions; in the Frenchman it was endured for lucrative trade. Anything higher
was left to the missionary, who, while he led the pioneer life, failed in turn to develop
it.</p>

<p>We may sum up what is to be said of the St. Lawrence Valley, that it is the best
inlet to the continent north of the Mississippi River, affording an easy way to the heart
of the continent for six months of the year. The valley is peculiar in the fact that
it has no distinct southern boundary, and that a large part of its area is occupied by
a system of fresh-water lakes. These sheets of water and this absence of a strong
ridge separating this basin from the water-sheds which lie to the south of it would, if
the French had been strong in a military sense, have given them an advantage in the
struggle for the continent; but as long as this valley was held by a less powerful people
than their neighbors on the south, these geographical features would no longer be
advantageous to its occupiers.</p>

<p>The soil and climate of the St. Lawrence Valley are both rather against the rapid
development of agriculture, requiring far more labor to make them arable, and giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mxxiii" id="Page_mxxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
a more limited return than do the more southern soils; so that, despite the very great
advantage which came from the peculiarly open nature of this path into the interior
of the continent, the French did not succeed in maintaining themselves there until
its great military advantages could be turned to profit.</p>

<p>At the present time the existence of railways has greatly lessened the value of
geography as a factor in military movements, and the St. Lawrence, closed as it is
for nearly half a year by ice, has no longer any military importance. As it is, we may
be surprised that it has not played a more important part in the military history of
the continent than it has done. We cannot avoid the conclusion that if the conditions
had been reversed, and the English settlements had occupied the Valley of
the St. Lawrence, and the French colonies the country to the southward, the English
colonists would have made use of its advantages in a more effective way.</p>

<p>The settlements at the mouth of the Mississippi did not come into the hands of
the French until a late day; but the use they made of this, the easiest navigated of all
the great American rivers, was considerable. These settlements were pushed up the
valley of the main stream and its greater tributaries, until they practically controlled the
larger part of the shores of the main waters. The swift current of the Mississippi and
its tributaries made ascending navigation difficult and costly. It was, in fact, only with
small cargoes in little boats propelled by poles, or with the aid of sails when the winds
favored, that the stream could be mounted. The effective navigation was downward
towards the mouth. By way of the Mississippi the French power worked into the
centre of the continent far more rapidly than by the St. Lawrence route; indeed, the advance
was so rapid that if these Gallic settlements had not been overwhelmed by the
stronger tide of the English people getting across the Alleghanies, a few years would
have given them a chance to fix their institutions and population in this valley.</p>

<p>Throughout their efforts in North America, the French showed a capacity for
understanding the large questions of political geography, a genius for exploration,
and a talent for making use of its results, or guiding their way to dominion, that is
in singular contrast with the blundering processes of their English rivals. They seem
to have understood the possibilities of the Mississippi Valley a century and a half before
the English began to understand them. They planted a system of posts and laid
out lines for commerce through this region; they strove to organize the natives into
civilized communities; they did all that the conditions permitted to achieve success.
Their failure must be attributed to the want of colonists, to the essential irreclaimableness
of the American savage, and to the want of a basis for extended commerce in this
country. There were no precious metals to tempt men into this wilderness, and none
of the fancy for life or for lands among the home people, that wandering instinct
which has been the basis of all the imperial power of the English race. Thus a most
cleverly devised scheme of continental occupation, which was admirably well adapted
to the physical conditions of the country, never came near to success. It fell beneath
the clumsy power of another race that had the capacity for fixing itself firmly in new
lands, and that grew without distinct plan until it came to possess it altogether.</p>

<p>The British settlements on the American coast were not very well placed for other
than the immediate needs that led to their planting. They did not hold any one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mxxiv" id="Page_mxxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>
the three water-ways which led from the coast into the interior of the continent, as
we have seen the French obtained control of the St. Lawrence and the Mississippi,
and as is well known the Dutch possession of the Hudson, which constituted the third
and least complete of the water-ways into the interior of the continent.</p>

<p>As regards their physical conditions, the original English colonies are divisible into
three groups,&mdash;those of New England; those of the Chesapeake and Delaware district,
including Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, and the central part
of North Carolina; and those on the coast region of the Carolinas. Each of these
regions has its proper physical characters, which have had special effects upon their
early history. In New England we have a shore-line that affords an excellent
system of harbors for craft of all sizes, and a sea that abounds in fish. The
land has a rugged surface made up of old mountain folds, which have been worn
down to their roots by the sea and by the glaciers of many ice periods. There are
no extended plains, and where small patches of level land occur, as along the sea,
there they are mostly of a rather barren and sandy character. The remainder of the
surface is very irregular, and nearly one half of it is either too steep for tillage or
consists of exposed rocks. The soil is generally of clay, and was originally covered
almost everywhere with closely sown boulders that had to be removed before the
plough could do its work. The rivers are mostly small, and from their numerous
rapids not navigable to any great distance from the sea, and none of their valleys
afford natural ways to the interior of the continent. In general structure this region
is an isolated mass separated from the body of the continent by the high ridges
of the Green Mountains and the Berkshire Hills, as well as by the deep valley
in which lie the Hudson and Lake Champlain. The climate is rigorous, only less
so than that of Canada. There are not more than seven months for agricultural
labor.</p>

<p>The New-England district, including therein what we may term the Acadian Peninsula
of North America, or all east of Lake Champlain and the Hudson and south
of the St. Lawrence, is more like Northern Europe than any other part of America.</p>

<p>Nature does not give with free hands in this region, yet it offered some advantages
to the early settlers. The general stubbornness of the soil made the coast Indians
few in number, while its isolation secured it from the more powerful tribes of the West.
The swift rivers afforded abundant water-power, that was early turned to use, and in
time became the most valuable possession that the land afforded. The climate, though
strenuous, was not unwholesome, and its severity gave protection against the malarial
fevers which have so hindered the growth of settlements in more southern regions.
Maize and pumpkins could be raised over a large part of its surface, and afforded
cheap and wholesome food with little labor. The rate of gain upon the primeval
forest was at first very slow; none of the products of the soil, except in a few instances
its timber, had at first any value for exportation. The only surplusage was found
in the products of the sea. In time the demand for food from the West Indian
Islands made it somewhat profitable to export grain. Practically, however, these
colonies grew without important help from any foreign commerce awakened by the
products of their soil. Their considerable foreign trade grew finally upon exchanges,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mxxv" id="Page_mxxv">[xxv]</a></span>
or on the products of the sea-fisheries and whaling. Even the trade in furs, which
was so important a feature in the French possessions, never amounted to an important
commerce in New England. The aborigines were not so generally engaged
in hunting, nor were the rivers of New England ever very rich in valuable fur-bearing
species. The most we can say of New England is, that it offered a chance for a
vigorous race to found in safety colonies that should get their power out of their
own toil, with little help from fortune. It was very badly placed for the occupancy
of a people who were to use it as a vantage-ground whence to secure control over
the inner parts of the continent. But for the modern improvement in commercial
ways, the isolation of this section from the other parts of the continent would have
kept it from ever attaining the importance in American life which now belongs to it.</p>

<p>The settlements that were made along the Hudson were, as regards their position,
much better placed than were those in New England. The valley of this stream is, as
is well known to geologists, a part of the great mountain trough separating from the
newer Alleghanian system on the west the old mountain system of the Appalachians,
which, known by the separate names of the Green Mountains, Berkshire Hills, South
Mountains, Blue Ridge, and Black Mountains, stretches from the St. Lawrence to
the northern part of Georgia. In the Hudson district the Appalachian or eastern
wall of the valley is known as the Berkshire Hills and the Green Mountains, while the
western or Alleghanian wall is formed by the Catskill Mountains and their northern
continuation in the Hilderberg Hills. On the south the Appalachian wall falls away,
allowing the stream a wide passage to the sea; on the northwestern side the Catskills
decline, opening the wide passage through which flows the Mohawk out of the broad
fertile upland valley which it drains. It appears likely that the Mohawk Valley for a
while in recent geological times afforded a passage of the waters of Lake Ontario to
the channel of the Hudson. This will serve to show how easy the passage is between
the Hudson Valley and the heart of the continent. Save that it is not a water-way,
this valley affords, through the plain of the Mohawk, the most perfect passage through
the long mountain line of the Alleghanies. Before this passage could have any importance
to its first European owners, it fell into the hands of the English settlers.
The fertility of this valley of the Hudson and Mohawk is far greater than that of New
England. A larger portion of the land is arable, and it is generally more fertile than
that of the region to the east. The underlying rock of the country is generally
charged with lime, which assures a better soil for grain crops than those derived from
the more argillaceous formations of New England. The Mohawk is for its size perhaps
the most fertile valley in America. The climate of this district is on the whole
more severe than that of New England, but the summer temperature admits the
cultivation of all the crops of the Northern States.</p>

<p>Though from Holland, the original settlers of the Hudson Valley were by race
and motives so closely akin to the English settlers to the north and south of them
that a perfect fusion has taken place. The Dutch language is dead save in the
mouths of a few aged people, and of their institutions nothing has remained.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The most striking contrast between the physical conditions of the New York
colony and those of New England is its relative isolation from the sea. Staten Island
and Long Island are strictly maritime; the rest is almost continental in its relations.</p>

<p>South of New York the conditions of the colonists as regards agriculture were
very different from what they were north of that point. To the north the soil is altogether
the work of the glacial period. It is on this account stony and hard to bring
into cultivation, as before described; but when once rendered arable, it is very enduring,
changing little with centuries of cropping. South of this point the soil is
derived from the rocks which lie below it, save just along the sea and the streams.
The decayed rock that happens to lie just beneath the surface produces a fertile or
an infertile earth, varied in quality according as the rocks. On the whole it is less
enduring than are the soils of New England, though it is much easier to bring it into
an arable state. It also differs from glacial soil in the fact that there is an absolute
dependence of the qualities it possesses upon the subjacent rock. When that changes,
the soil at once undergoes a corresponding alteration. In certain regions it may be
more fertile than any glacial soil ever is; again, its infertility may be extreme, as, for
instance, when the underlying rocks are sandstones containing little organic matter.</p>

<p>In this southern belt the region near the shore is rather malarial. The soil there
is sandy, and of a little enduring nature, and the drainage is generally bad. Next
within this line we have the fringe of higher country which lies to the east of the Blue
Ridge. This consists of a series of rolling plains, generally elevated four or five
hundred feet above the sea. Near the Blue Ridge it is changed into a rather hilly
district, with several ranges of detached mountains upon its surface; to the east it
gradually declines into the plain which borders the sea. Within the Blue Ridge it
has the steep walls of the old granite mountains, which, inconspicuous in New Jersey,
increase in Pennsylvania to important hills, become low mountains of picturesque form
in Virginia, and finally in North and South Carolina attain the highest elevation of any
land in eastern North America. This mountain range widens as it increases in height,
and the plains that border it on the east grow also in height and width as we go to the
southward in Virginia. All this section is composed of granite and other ancient rocks,
which by their decay afford a very good soil. Beyond the Blue Ridge, and below
its summits, are the Alleghanies. Between them is a broad mountain valley, known
to geologists as the great Appalachian valley. This is an elevated irregular table-land,
generally a thousand feet or more above the sea, and mostly underlaid by limestone,
which by its decay affords a very fertile soil. This singular valley is traceable all the
way from Lake Champlain to Georgia. The whole course of the Hudson lies within
it. As all the mountains rise to the southward, this valley has its floor constantly
farther and farther above the sea, until in Southern Virginia much of its surface is
about two thousand feet above that level. This southward increase of elevation secures
it a somewhat similar climate throughout its whole length. This, the noblest valley in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mxxvii" id="Page_mxxvii">[xxvii]</a></span>
America, is a garden in fertility, and of exceeding beauty. Yet west of this valley the
Alleghanies proper extend, a wide belt of mountains, far to the westward. Their surface
is generally rugged, but not infertile; they, as well as the Blue Ridge, are clad
with thick forests to their very summits.</p>

<p>The shore of this, the distinctly southern part of the North American coast, is
deeply indented by estuaries, which have been cut out principally by the tides. These
deep sounds and bays,&mdash;the Delaware, Chesapeake, Pamlico, Albemarle, and others,&mdash;with
their very many ramifications, constitute a distinctive feature in North America.
Although these indentations are probably not of glacial origin, except perhaps the
Delaware, they much resemble the great fjords which the glaciers have produced along
the shores of regions farther to the northward. By means of these deep and ramified
bays all the country of Virginia and Maryland lying to the east of the Appalachians
is easily accessible to ships of large size. This was a very advantageous feature in
the development of the export trade of this country, as it enabled the planters to load
their crops directly into the ships which conveyed them to Europe, and this spared
the making of roads,&mdash;a difficult task in a new country. The principal advantage of
this set of colonies lay in the fact that they were fitted to the cultivation of tobacco.
The demand for this product laid the foundations of American commerce, and was
full of good and evil consequences to this country. It undoubtedly gave the means
whereby Virginia became strong enough to be, on the part of the South, the mainstay
of the resistance of the colonies to the mother country. On the other hand, it made
African slavery profitable, and so brought that formidable problem of a foreign and
totally alien race to be for all time a trouble to this country. Although the cultivation
of cotton gave the greatest extension to slavery, it is not responsible for its firm establishment
on our soil. That was the peculiar work of tobacco.</p>

<p>The climate of this region is perhaps the best of the United States. The winters
want the severity that characterizes them in the more northern States, and the considerable
height of the most of the district relieves it of danger from fevers. I have
elsewhere spoken of the evidences that this district has maintained the original energy
of the race that founded its colonies.</p>

<p>The Carolinian colonies are somewhat differently conditioned from those of Virginia,
and their history has been profoundly influenced by their physical circumstances.
South of the James River the belt of low-lying ground near the sea-shore widens
rapidly, until the nearest mountain ranges are one hundred and fifty miles or more from
the shore. This shore belt is also much lower than it is north of the James; a large
part of its surface is below the level where the drainage is effective, and so is unfit for
tillage. Much of it is swamp. The rivers do not terminate in as deep and long bays,
with steep clay banks for borders, as they do north of the James. They are generally
swamp-bordered in their lower courses, and not very well suited for settlements.</p>

<p>The soil of these regions is generally rather infertile; it is especially unfitted for the
cultivation of grains except near the shore, where the swamps can often be converted
into good rice-fields. Maize can be tilled, but it, as well as wheat, barley, etc., gives
not more than half the return that may be had from them in Virginia. Were it not
for the cotton crop, the lowland South would have fared badly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mxxviii" id="Page_mxxviii">[xxviii]</a></span></p>

<p>All the shore belt of country is unwholesome, being affected with pernicious fevers,
which often cannot be endured by the whites, even after the longest acclimatization.
The interior region, even when not much elevated above the sea, or away from the
swamps, is a healthy country, and the district within sight of the Blue Ridge and the
Black Mountains is a very salubrious district. This region was, however, not at
once accessible to the colonists of the Carolinian shore, and was not extensively settled
for some time after the country was first inhabited, and then was largely occupied by
the descendants of the Virginian colonists.</p>

<p>The history of this country has served to show that much of the lowlands near
the shore is not well fitted for the use of European peoples; they are likely to
fall into the possession of the African folk, who do not suffer, but rather seem to prosper
in the feverish lowlands. The interior districts beyond the swamp country are well
suited to Europeans, and where the surface rises more than one thousand feet above
the sea, as it does in western North and South Carolina, the climate is admirably well
suited to the European race. It is probable that the English race has never been in
a more favorable climate than these uplands afford.</p>

<p>This Carolinian section was originally settled by a far more diversified population
than that which formed the colonies to the northward. This was especially the case
in North Carolina. This colony was originally possessed by a land company, which
proposed to find its profit in a peculiar fashion. This company paid contractors so
much a head for human beings put ashore in the colony. One distinguished trader in
population, a certain Baron de Graffenreid, settled several thousand folk at and about
New Berne, on the swampy shores of the Eastern sounds. They were from a great
variety of places,&mdash;a part from England, others from the banks of the Rhine, others
again from Switzerland. There was a great mass of human driftwood in Europe at
the close of the seventeenth century, the wreck of long-continued wars; so it was easy
to bring immigrants by the shipload if they were paid for. But the material was unfit
to be the foundation of a State. From this settlement of eastern North Carolina is
descended the most unsatisfactory population in this country. The central and
western parts of North Carolina had an admirable population, that principally came to
the State through Virginia; but this population about Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds,
though its descendants are numerous, perhaps not numerically much inferior to that
which came from the Virginia settlements, is vastly inferior to it in all the essential
qualities of the citizen. From the Virginia people have come a great number of men
of national and some of world-wide reputation. It is not likely that any other population,
averaging in numbers about five hundred thousand souls, has in a century
furnished as many able men. On the other hand, this eastern North Carolina
people has given no men of great fame to the history of the country, while a large
part of the so-called “poor white” population of the South appears to be descended
from the mongrel folk who were turned ashore on the eastern border of
North Carolina.</p>

<p>South Carolina was much more fortunate in its early settlers on its seaboard than
the colony to the north. Its population was drawn from rather more varied sources
than that of Virginia, New York, or New England, but it would be hard to say that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mxxix" id="Page_mxxix">[xxix]</a></span>
its quality was inferior; despite the considerable admixture of Irish and French blood,
it was essentially an English colony.</p>

<p>On the whole, although the quality of the climate would lead some to expect a
lowering of the quality of the English race in these southern colonies, it is not possible
to trace any such effect in the people. Although the laboring classes of whites along
the seaboard appear to occupy a physical level rather below that of the same class in
Virginia and the more northern regions, they have great endurance,&mdash;as was sufficiently
proven by the fact that they made good soldiers during the recent Civil War. In the
upland districts of these States, in western North and South Carolina, and especially in
northern Georgia, the physical constitution of the people is, I believe, the best in this
country. In the district north of Pennsylvania, the elevation of the mountains, or the
table-lands which lie about them, is not profitable to the dwellers in these districts;
each added height scarcely gives any additional healthfulness, and the additional cold
is hurtful to most crops. In this southern region, however, the greater height and
width of the Appalachian mountain system, including its elevated valleys, is a very
great advantage to this region in all that concerns its fitness for the use of man.
The climate of one half of the country south of the James and Ohio Rivers and east
of the Mississippi is purified and refreshed by the elevations of this noble mountain
system. It is the opinion of all who have examined this country, that it is extremely
well fitted for all the uses of the race: an admirable climate, much resembling that
of the Apennines of Tuscany, a fertile soil admitting a wide diversity of products,
and a great abundance of water-power characterize all this upland district of the
South.</p>

<p>A few words will suffice for all that concerns the mineral resources of the original
colonies. At the outset of the colonization of America we hear a good deal about the
search for gold; fortunately there was a very uniform failure in the first efforts to find
this metal, so that it ceased to play a part in the history of these colonies. Very little
effort to develop the mineral resources of this region was made during the colonial
period. A little iron was worked in Rhode Island, New York, and Virginia, some
search of a rather fruitless sort was made for copper ore in Connecticut, but of mining
industry, properly so called, there was nothing until the Revolutionary War stimulated
the search for iron and lead ores. The discovery of the gold deposits in the Carolinas
did not come about until after the close of the colonial period. These deposits
were not sufficiently rich to excite an immigration of any moment to the fields where
they occur.</p>

<p>Practically the mineral resources of what we may term the Appalachian settlements
of North America never formed any part of the inducements which led immigrants to
them. In this respect they differ widely from the other colonies which were planted
in the Americas. The greater part of the Spanish and Portuguese settlements in
America were made by gold-hunters. The state of morals which led to these settlements
was not favorable to the formation of communities characterized by high
motives. There were doubtless other influences at work to lower the moral quality
of the settlements in Mexico and South America, but the nature of the motives
which brought the first settlers upon the ground and gave the tone to society is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mxxx" id="Page_mxxx">[xxx]</a></span>
certainly not the least important of the influences which have affected the history of
the American settlements.</p>

<p>To close this brief account of the physical conditions of the first European settlements
in North America, we may say, that the English colonies were peculiarly fortunate
in those physical conditions upon which they fell. There is no area in either of
the Americas, or for that matter in the world outside of Europe, where it would have
been possible to plant English colonies that would have been found so suitable for
the purpose: climate, soil, contact with the sea, and a chance of dominion over the
whole continent were given them by fortune. They had but the second choice in the
division of the New World; yet to the English fell the control of those regions which
experience has shown to hold its real treasures. Fortune has repeatedly blessed
this race; but never has she bestowed richer gifts than in the chance that gave it
the Appalachian district of America.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p class="pc1 mid">CORTEREAL, VERRAZANO, GOMEZ, THEVET.</p>

<p class="pc1">BY GEORGE DEXTER.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">JOHN CABOT discovered the continent of North America June 24,
1497; and his son Sebastian the next year coasted its shores for a
considerable distance,&mdash;perhaps even, as some accounts say, from Hudson’s
Bay to North Carolina.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The reports of their voyages doubtless
reached the Continental courts of Europe without delay. Spain was occupied
with the attempts of Columbus to attain the Indies by a southern
route promising success; while Portugal, always among the foremost maritime
nations, had now an energetic ruler in her young King Emanuel, who
had succeeded to the throne in 1495. He had already sent out Vasco da
Gama and Cabral, who followed the route to the Indies by the way of the
Cape of Good Hope;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and he was well disposed also for an attempt to
pursue the indications given by the Cabots, that a short way to the Land
of Spices might lie through a northwest passage among the islands, of
which the New World was still supposed to consist. Such is at least generally
thought to have been the reason for the expeditions of the Cortereals,
although we have no official reports of their voyages or their aims.</p>

<p>The family of Cortereal was not without position in the Portuguese
kingdom. Ioâo Vaz Cortereal had been appointed, some years before
this time, hereditary governor of the Island of Terceira; and his sons had
perhaps learned there the secrets of navigation. It has been even asserted
by some Portuguese writers that this Ioâo Vaz had himself discovered some
part of America nearly thirty years before the first voyage of Columbus,
and had received his governorship as the reward of the discovery; but
there is no evidence for this claim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>It is known, however, that in the year 1500 a son of Ioâo Vaz, Gaspar
Cortereal, having obtained from the King a grant or license to discover
new islands, fitted out one, or perhaps two, vessels, with the help of his
brother Miguel, and sailed from Lisbon early in the summer for a voyage
to the northwest. The accounts say that he touched at the family island
of Terceira, and in due time returned to Portugal with a report of having
landed in a country situated in a high degree of latitude, now supposed to
have been Greenland, which name, indeed (or rather its equivalent, <i>Terra
Verde</i>), he is said to have given to the country. The details of the voyage
are scanty, and have been confused with those of the second expedition;
but it was so far successful that the enterprise was renewed the next year.
Miguel Cortereal again contributed to the expenses of this second voyage.
It appears, indeed, from a letter of his dated August 6, and preserved
in the State archives at Lisbon, that he had prepared a vessel
with the expectation of sharing personally in the expedition, but was
delayed by a royal order to increase the number of his crew, and afterward
by contrary winds, until it was too late in the season to follow Gaspar
with any hope of success. Gaspar had sailed with three ships, May
15, 1501, and had directed his course west-northwest. After sailing in
this direction two thousand miles from Lisbon, he discovered a country
quite unknown up to that time. This he coasted six or seven hundred
miles without finding any end to the land; so he concluded that it must
be connected with the country discovered to the north the year before,
which country could not now be reached on account of the great quantity
of ice and snow. The number of large rivers encountered, encouraged
the navigators in their belief that the country was no island. They found
it very populous, and brought away a number of the natives; and those
savages who safely arrived in Portugal were described as “admirably calculated
for labor, and the best slaves I have ever seen.” A piece of a
broken sword, and two silver earrings, evidently of Italian manufacture,
found in the possession of the natives, were probably relics of the visit of
Cabot to the country three years earlier. One of the vessels reached Lisbon
on its return, October 8, and brought seven of the kidnapped natives.
It reported that another ship had fifty more of these. This vessel arrived
three days later with its expected cargo; but the third, with Gaspar Cortereal,
was never heard from. Her fate remained a mystery, although
several efforts were made to ascertain it.</p>

<p>The next year, 1502, Miguel Cortereal started with three ships (one
account says two) well equipped and found, having agreed with the King
to make a search for the missing Gaspar. The expedition sailed May 10.
Arriving on the American coast, they found so many entrances of rivers
and havens, that it was agreed to divide the fleet, the better to search for
the missing vessel. A rendezvous was arranged for the 20th of August.
Two ships met at the appointed time and place; but Miguel Cortereal’s
did not appear, and the others, after waiting some time, returned to Portugal.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400">EARLY FISHING STAGES.</p>
         <p class="pf400">[This cut is a fac-simile of one in the corner
of <i>A New and Correct Map of America</i>, 1738,
which belongs to Sir William Keith’s <i>History
of the British Plantations in America</i>: Part I.,
Virginia, London, 1738. It presumably represents
the fashion of these appliances of the fishermen
which had prevailed perhaps for centuries.</p>

<p class="pf400">It was suggested by Forster, <i>Northern Voyages</i>,
book iii. chaps. iii. and iv., that Breton
fishermen may have been on the Newfoundland
coast before Columbus. Scholars are coming
more and more to believe the possibility and
even probability of it. Every third day in the
calendar was then a fast-day, and the incentive
to seeking fish on distant seas was great. That
Cabot should find the natives of this region calling
the cod <i>baccalaos</i>, a name applied by the seamen
of the Bay of Biscay to that fish, has also
been suggestive; but this story, deducible apparently
from no earlier writer than Peter
Martyr in 1516, is not altogether trustworthy,
since there is doubt if the folk who called the
fish by that name were the natives, as Martyr
seems to think, or simply the common people, as
would seem to be implied in other forms of the
statement (see Vol. III. p. 45). Greenland, as we
know from the pre-Columbian maps (Ptolemy of
1482, etc.), was considered a part of Europe. Its
adjacent shores were in the common mind but
further outposts of the same continent; so that
the returned sailors’ reports of the distant parts&mdash;islands
they thought them&mdash;might cause no
awakening of the idea of a new world. Cf.

<p>Miguel also was never heard of again. Another expedition, sent
out at the expense of the King, a year later, returned without having found
a trace of either brother. And yet once more, the oldest of the family,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Vasqueanes Cortereal, then governor of Terceira, proposed to undertake
the quest in person; but Emanuel refused the necessary permission, declining
to risk the lives of more of his subjects.</p>

<p>The Cortereals had no successors among their countrymen in the attempt
to reach the Indies by the Northwest Passage; but their voyages
opened for Portugal a source of much trade. Individuals, and perhaps
companies or associations, soon followed in their track in the pursuit of
fish, until the Portuguese enterprises of this sort on the American coasts
grew to large proportions, and produced considerable revenue for the
State.</p>

<p class="p2">The consolidation of France into one great kingdom may be said to date
from 1524, when the death of Claude, the wife of Francis I., vested the
hereditary right to the succession of Brittany in the crown of France. The
marriage of Charles VIII. with Anne, Claude’s mother, in 1491, had brought
the last of the feudal fiefs into subjection; but it required many years to
make the inhabitants of these provinces Frenchmen, and the rulers at Paris
exercised little authority over the towns and principalities of the interior.
The coasts of Normandy and Brittany were peopled by a race of adventurous
mariners, some of them exercising considerable power; as, for instance,
the Angos of Dieppe, one of whom (Jean) was ennobled, and created
viscount and captain of that town. Such places as Dieppe, Honfleur, St.
Malo, and others had already furnished men and leaders for voyages of
exploration and discovery. These had made expeditions to the Canaries
and the African coast, and the fishing population of the French provinces
were not unused to voyages of considerable length. They were not slow,
then, in seeking a share in the advantages offered by the new countries
discovered by Cabot and Cortereal, and they speedily became skilful and
powerful in the American fisheries. The fishermen of the ports of Brittany
are known to have reached the Newfoundland shores as early as 1504.
They have left there an enduring trace in the name of Cape Breton, which,
in one form or another, is found upon very early maps. Two years afterward
Jean Denys, who was from Honfleur, is said to have visited the Gulf
of St. Lawrence, and to have made a chart of it; but what now passes for
such a chart is clearly of later origin. Another two years elapse, and we
read of the voyage, in 1508, of a Dieppe mariner, Thomas Aubert by name,
who is said to have brought home the first specimens of the American
natives. A contemporary chronicle relates the visit of seven of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
savages to Rouen in 1509. The frequency of the voyages of these fishermen
and their skill in navigation are proved by the provision in Juan de
Agramonte’s commission from the Spanish Crown, in 1511, that he might
employ as pilots of his proposed expedition two mariners from Brittany.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
In 1518, or (as M. d’Avezac thinks) perhaps a few years later, the
Baron de Léry attempted a French settlement in the new country. But
storms and unfavorable circumstances brought about the failure of this
expedition.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p class="p2">We have few particulars of the early life of Giovanni da Verrazano, who
commanded the first French expedition sent out under royal auspices.
The date of his birth is uncertain; but he is supposed to have been born
shortly after 1480, in Florence,&mdash;where members of the family had attained
high office at various times,&mdash;and to have been the son of Piero
Andrea da Verrazano and Fiametta Capella. He is said to have travelled
extensively, to have passed some years in Egypt and Syria, and to have
visited the East Indies. It has also been stated, but on doubtful authority,
that he commanded one of Aubert’s ships in that mariner’s expedition to
America in 1508. With the year 1521 Verrazano begins to appear in
Spanish history as a French corsair; in which character, and under the
name of Juan Florin or Florentin, he preyed upon the commerce between
Spain and her new-found possessions. It was, perhaps, while engaged in
this occupation that he gained the notice and favor of Francis I. Indeed,
his voyage of discovery was immediately preceded by, or even connected
with, one of these predatory cruises. The Portuguese ambassador in
France, Joâo da Silveira, wrote home, April 25, 1523: “Joâo Verezano,
who is going on the discovery of Cathay, has not left up to this date, for
want of opportunity, and because of differences, I understand, between
himself and men.” And Verrazano himself says, in the cosmographical
appendix to his letter, that the object of his expedition was to reach Cathay
by a westward voyage, and that he expected to be able to penetrate any
intervening land. But we know from Spanish sources that in May or June
of this same year, 1523, Juan Florin captured the treasure sent home by
Cortes to the Emperor, and brought it into La Rochelle; and Verrazano
speaks in the beginning of his letter to the King of his success against the
Spaniards.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>Later in the year, perhaps (but it seems impossible now to separate the
voyage of discovery distinctly from the cruise against Spanish commerce),
Verrazano started with four ships. Disabled by storms, he was forced to
put back into some port of Brittany with two vessels, the “Normandy”
and the “Dauphine.” After repairing these, he made a fresh start, but
decided finally to proceed on the voyage to Cathay with the “Dauphine”
alone.</p>

<p>In this vessel he sailed, Jan. 17, 1524, from the Desiertas Rocks, near
the Island of Madeira, having fifty men and provisions for eight months.
For twenty-five days he proceeded, with a pleasant breeze, toward the
west, without any incident. Then on February 14 (20, according to
another version of his letter) he encountered a very violent tempest.
Escaping from this, he continued the voyage, changing the course of
the vessel more to the north, and in another twenty-five days came
within sight of land. This appeared low when first seen; and on a
nearer approach it gave evidence, from the fires burning on the shore,
that there were inhabitants. This landfall Verrazano places in 34° N.,
which would be not far from the latitude of Cape Fear, upon the coast
of North Carolina; and most commentators upon his letter accept that
as the probable point. He began his search for a harbor by coasting
south about fifty leagues; but finding none, and observing that the land
continued to extend in that direction, he turned and sailed along the
shore to the north. Still finding no opportunity to land with the vessel,
he decided to send a boat ashore. This was met on its approach to
the land by a crowd of the natives, who at first turned to fly, but were
recalled by friendly signs, and at last showed the strangers the best place
for making a landing, and offered them food. These people were nearly
black in color, of moderate stature and good proportions. They went
naked except for their breech-cloths, and were, from the description, simple
and of kind disposition. The coast is described as covered with small
sand-hills, and as pierced by occasional inlets, behind which appeared a
higher country, with fields and great forests giving out pleasant odors.
There were noticed, also, lakes and ponds, with abundance of birds and
beasts. The anchorage Verrazano thought a safe one; for though there
was no harbor, he says that the water continued deep very close to the
shore, and there was excellent holding-ground for the anchor.</p>

<p>Thence he proceeded along a shore trending east, seeing great fires,
which gave him the impression that the country had many inhabitants.
While at anchor (perhaps near Raleigh Bay), the boat was sent to the
shore for water. There was no possibility of landing, on account of the
high surf; so a young sailor undertook to swim to the land, and to give
the natives some bells or other trinkets which the French had brought for
the purposes of traffic, or for presents. He was overpowered by the waves,
and, after a struggle, thrown upon the beach, where he lay almost stunned.
The Indians ran down, picked him up, and carried him screaming with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
fright up the shore. They reassured him by signs, stripped off his wet
clothes, and dried him by one of their fires,&mdash;much to the horror, says the
narrative, of his comrades in the boat, who supposed that the savages
intended to roast and eat him. When he was refreshed and recovered
from his fright, he made them understand that he wished to rejoin his
friends, whereupon the natives accompanied him back to the water, and
watched his safe return to the boat.</p>

<p>Following the shore, which here turned somewhat to the north, in fifty
leagues more they reached a pleasant place, much wooded, near which
they anchored. Here they landed twenty men to examine the country,
and made a cruel return for the kindness which the natives had shown the
French sailor a short time before. On landing, the men found that the
Indians had taken refuge in the woods, with the exception of two women
and some small children who had attempted to hide in the long grass.
The Frenchmen offered food; but the younger woman refused it, and in
great fright called for help to the natives who had fled into the forest.
The French took the oldest of the children, a boy of eight, and carried
him to their vessel, to take back with them to France. They attempted to
kidnap also the young woman, who was handsome and tall, about eighteen
years of age; but she succeeded in escaping. The people of this place are
described as fairer than those first seen, and the country as fertile and
beautiful, but colder than the other.</p>

<p>The vessel remained at anchor three days, and then it was decided to
continue the voyage, but to sail only in the daytime, and to anchor each
night. After coursing a hundred leagues to the northeast, they arrived at
a beautiful spot where, between small steep hills, a great stream poured its
waters into the sea. This river was of great depth at its mouth, and with
the help of the tide a heavily loaded vessel could easily enter. As Verrazano
had good anchorage for his ship, he sent his boat in. This, after
going a half league, found that the entrance widened into a magnificent
lake of three leagues circuit, upon which at least thirty of the natives’ boats
were passing from shore to shore. These people received the strangers
kindly, and showed them the best place to bring their boat to the land.
A sudden squall from the sea frightened the French, and they returned
in haste to the ship without exploring further this pleasant harbor,&mdash;which
seems to have been that of New York.</p>

<p>Thence they sailed to the east about eighty leagues (fifty, by one account),
keeping the land always in sight. They discovered an island of triangular
shape, of about the size of that of Rhodes, and about ten leagues from the
mainland, to which they gave the name of Louisa, the mother of Francis I.,&mdash;the
only name mentioned in the narrative. This was covered with
woods, and well peopled, as the number of fires showed. From this island,
which has been generally identified with Block Island,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Verrazano, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
landing, as the weather was bad, steered for the coast again; and in fifteen
leagues (perhaps retracing his course) came to a most beautiful harbor.
Here the ship was met by many boats of the natives, who crowded close
around it with cries of astonishment and pleasure. They were easily persuaded
to come on board, and soon became very friendly. This harbor,
which Verrazano places in the parallel of Rome, 41° 40´ N., and which has
been identified as that of Newport, is described as opening toward the south,
with an entrance a half league in breadth, and widening into a great bay
twenty leagues in circuit. It contained five islands, among which any fleet
might find refuge from storms or other dangers. The entrance could be
easily guarded by a fort built upon a rock which seemed naturally placed
in its centre for defence. The natives are described as fine-looking, the
handsomest people seen in the voyage, of taller stature than Europeans,
of light color, sharp faces, with long black hair and black eyes, but with
a mild expression. The visits of their kings to the strange vessel are described,
and the eagerness of these rulers to know the use of everything
they saw is mentioned. The women are spoken of as modest in their
behavior, and as jealously guarded by their husbands. The interior
country was explored for a short distance, and found pleasant and adapted
to cultivation, with many large open plains entirely free from trees, and
with forests not so dense but that they could easily be penetrated.</p>

<p>In this agreeable harbor, where everything that he saw filled him with
delight, and where the kindness of the inhabitants left him nothing to
desire, Verrazano tarried fifteen days. Then having supplied himself with
all necessaries, he departed on the 6th of May (Ramusio says the 5th), and
sailed a hundred and fifty leagues without losing sight of the land, which
showed small hills, and was a little higher than before, while the coast,
after about fifty leagues, turned to the north. No stop was made, for the
wind was favorable, and the nature of the country appeared much the
same. The next landing was made in a colder country, full of thick woods,
where the natives were rude, and showed no desire to communicate with the
strangers. They were clothed in skins, and their land seemed barren.
They would accept nothing in barter but knives, fish-hooks, and sharpened
steel. When the French landed and attempted to explore the country, they
were attacked. This landing has been placed somewhere north of Boston,
possibly not far from Portsmouth, in New Hampshire.</p>

<p>The voyage was continued in a northeasterly direction. The coast appeared
pleasanter, open, and free from woods, with a sight of high mountains
far inland. Within a distance of fifty leagues thirty-two islands were
discovered, all near the shore, which reminded the navigator of those in
the Adriatic. He did not stop to explore the country, or to open communication
with the natives, but continued another hundred and fifty
leagues in the same general direction, when he arrived at about the latitude
of 50° N. Here, having reached the country already discovered by the
Bretons, and finding his provisions and naval stores nearly exhausted, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
took in a fresh supply of wood and water, and decided to return to France,
having, he says, discovered more than seven hundred leagues of unknown
territory. He arrived at Dieppe on his return early in July, for his letter
to the King is dated from that port on the 8th of the month.</p>

<p>We lose trace of Verrazano after his return from this voyage. Francis I.
was in no condition to profit from the opportunity offered him to colonize
a new world. He had engaged in a struggle with the Emperor; was soon
after the date of this letter busily occupied in fighting battles; and at that
of Pavia, Feb. 24, 1525, was taken prisoner, and spent the next year in
captivity in Spain. It has been suggested that Verrazano went to England,
and there offered his services to Henry VIII., and there are contemporary
allusions supporting the suggestion. Mr. Biddle, in his <i>Memoir of Sebastian
Cabot</i>, advances the opinion that Verrazano was the Piedmontese pilot who
was killed and eaten by the savages in Rut’s expedition of 1527, which
would harmonize Ramusio’s statement that he made a second voyage to
America and lost his life there. But this is extremely doubtful.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> We
know from French sources that in 1526 Verrazano joined with Admiral
Chabot, Jean Ango, and others, in an agreement for a voyage to the Indies
for spices, with a proviso inserted for the equitable division of any booty
taken “from the Moors or others, enemies of the faith and the King our
lord.” Spanish documents of official character show that Juan Florin,
with other French pirates, was captured at sea in 1527, and hung at the
small village of Colmenar, between Salamanca and Toledo, in November
of that year. But it has been also lately stated that a letter has been
found, dated at Paris, Nov. 14, 1527, which speaks of Verrazano as <i>then</i>
preparing an expedition of five ships for America, expecting to sail the
following spring. If this statement is accurate, and the date of the letter
has been correctly read, grave doubts are thrown upon the Spanish story
of his execution. Either Florin was not Verrazano, or he was not hanged
at the time stated. I cannot undertake to reconcile all these statements,
but must leave them as I find them.</p>

<p class="p2">The voyage of Estévan (Stephen) Gomez, although not made under the
flag of France, should, perhaps, be studied in connection with that of
Verrazano. Spain did not fail to take notice of the discoveries of the
Cabots when the news of the return of Sebastian from the second voyage
reached London in 1498. Her ambassador at that Court, Don Pedro de
Ayala, in his despatch dated July 25 of that year, says that he has given
notice to the English king that the countries discovered by Cabot belonged
to his master. There are traces of voyages in a northwestern direction
under Spanish auspices in subsequent years. Navarrete thinks that such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
was the object of the Spanish king in sending for Juan Dornelos, or Dorvelos,
in the spring of 1500. It is stated also that Hojeda had orders about
the same time to follow the English tracks. The commission to Agramonte
in 1511 (he having proposed a similar project previously) was for
the purpose of planting a settlement in the <i>tierra nueva</i> at the northwest.
Magellan’s discovery of the long-sought strait through the New World leading
to the Land of Spices, although it brought no immediate advantages, as
the voyage was long and perilous, revived and increased the interest in
seeking for a shorter and more northern passage. The agreement made
with De Ayllon, June 12, 1523, provided, among other things, for the search
for another way through the continent to the Moluccas, to be found north
of Florida. Hernando Cortes wrote home to the Emperor, Oct. 15, 1524,
a letter on the probability of there being such a passage easier than the one
already discovered, and proposed to seek for it. Gomez was of the same
opinion, for his voyage was undertaken to find this northern strait.</p>

<p>Estévan Gomez was a Portuguese and an experienced navigator. He
had entered the service of Spain a few years before this time, having received
the appointment of pilot in 1518 at the same time that Sebastian
Cabot was created “pilot major.” He had sailed with Magellan on his
great voyage as pilot of the “San Antonio,” but had joined the crew of
that vessel in their mutiny against her captain, Alvaro de Mesquita, at the
strait. He thus deserted Magellan, and brought the ship home. In 1521
he was ordered to serve with the fleet which was then preparing to sail
against the French corsairs. He obtained a concession from the Emperor,
dated March 27, 1523, by which he was to have a small vessel for an expedition
to the northwest, armed and provisioned for one year. Although this
grant, like that made soon afterward to De Ayllon, contained a proviso
that the expedition should carefully avoid trespassing upon the King of
Portugal’s possessions in the New World, that Power seems to have raised
objections to the voyage. The following year a council was convened at
the small town of Badajos for the settlement of the rival claims of Spain
and Portugal, and Gomez was sent with Cabot, Juan Vespucius, and others
to this council,&mdash;not as members, but in the capacity of <i>specialists</i> or <i>experts</i>,
to give opinions on questions of navigation and cosmography. The
congress accomplished nothing in the way of an agreement between the
rival Powers, and after its adjournment the Council for the Indies decided
to allow the voyage proposed by Gomez.</p>

<p>Gomez sailed from Corunna, a port in the north of Spain, to which the
“Casa de Contratacion,” or India House, had been removed from Seville,
some time in February of the following year (1525), and was absent about
ten months. We have unfortunately no detailed account of his voyage,
and it does not now seem possible to say with certainty even in which
direction he explored the American coast. The accounts given by the
Spanish historians are very meagre. They seem to have paid little attention
to the voyage, except to record its failure to discover the desired northern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
strait. The Spanish maps, however, show plain traces of the voyage,
in the <i>Tierra de Estévan Gomez</i>, the name applied by Ribero and others to
the large tract of country between Cape Breton and Florida. Gomara, one
of the earliest and best authorities on American matters, heads the chapter
which he devotes to Gomez, “Rio de San Antonio,” which name is supposed
to be the one given in Spanish maps to the Hudson River. Gomez
is said to have visited the country at latitudes 40° and 41° north, and to have
coasted a great extent of land never before explored by the Spaniards. It
is related also that he visited the Island of Cuba, and refitted his vessel
there. This would be presumably on the homeward voyage. Failing to
obtain the rich cargo of spices which he had expected to bring home, he
loaded his vessel with kidnapped savages of both sexes, and with this
freight reached Corunna again in November, 1525.</p>

<p>All historians of the voyage made by Gomez have told the story about
the mistake of a zealous newsmonger in reference to the nature of the cargo
thus brought home. Peter Martyr is the first to tell it, in the final chapter
of his last decade, inscribed to Pope Clement VII., written in 1526. In answer
to a question as to what he had brought, Gomez was understood to
reply “cloves” (<i>clavos</i>), when he really said “slaves” (<i>esclavos</i>). The eager
friend hastened to Court with the news that the shorter strait had been discovered,
thinking to obtain some reward for his intelligence. The favorers
of Gomez’ project (in regard to which there appears to have been some
difference of opinion) greeted the news with applause, but were covered with
ridicule when the true story of the results of the voyage was published. Martyr
quaintly says: “If they hadd learned that the influence of the heauens
could bee noe where infused into terrestriall matters prepared to receiue
that aromaticall spirit, saue from the <i>Æquinoctiall</i> sunne, or next vnto it,
they woulde haue knowne that in the space of tenn moneths (wherein hee
performed his voyage) aromaticall Cloues could not bee founde.”<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p class="p2">It does not fall within the limits of this chapter to relate the story of the
early attempts of the French Huguenots to plant colonies in this country.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
But I may refer very briefly to the first of these,&mdash;the expedition sent by
Admiral Coligny to Brazil under the command of Villegagnon, in 1555; as
a Franciscan monk, André Thevet, who accompanied it, claims to have
coasted the continent of North America on his return voyage to France
the next year.</p>

<p>Thevet says of himself that he had spent the early years of his life in
travel, and that he had already made a voyage to the East, of which voyage,
and of his skill in navigation, his friend Villegagnon was well aware
when he asked him to join the proposed expedition to South America,&mdash;an
offer which he (Thevet) was very ready to accept. The start, he says,
was made from Havre, May 6, 1555, and the voyage across the ocean was
long and tedious. It was not until the last day of October that, about nine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
o’clock in the morning, their vessel came within sight of the high mountains
of Croistmourou. These were within the limits of a country whose
inhabitants were friends of the Portuguese, and the French therefore decided
to avoid landing there. They continued the voyage, and seventeen
days later cast anchor at the River Ganabara (Rio Janeiro), where they
were received in a friendly manner by the natives, and decided to make
their settlement.</p>

<p>Thevet remained with the colony only about ten weeks, leaving on his
homeward voyage, Jan. 31, 1556. He says that the commander of the
vessel decided to return by a more northern passage than that by which he
had crossed from France; and goes on to describe at some length their
voyage along the coast, and to give many particulars of the countries and
natives, most of which he must have obtained from other travellers’ books
and histories after his return. The progress was slow. At the Cape of
St. Augustine the vessel was delayed, he says, two months in the attempt
to round that promontory. The equinoctial line was not crossed until
about the middle of April; and after leaving Espagnola a contrary wind
blew them in toward the coast.</p>

<p>Thevet claims to have coasted the entire shore of the United States,
and gives occasional accounts of what he saw, and of intercourse with the
natives. But his details are always uncertain, and the places he professes
to have visited cannot be identified. No satisfactory information can be
obtained from his story; and indeed his reputation for truth-telling is so
poor that many historians are inclined to reject altogether his recital of the
voyage along our coast. It may well be that Thevet invented the whole
of it as a thread upon which to hang the particulars about Florida, Norumbega,
and other countries which he gathered from books. After his return
to France he was made <i>aumonier</i> to Catherine de Medicis, and also royal
historiographer and cosmographer.</p>

<h3><a name="c12" id="c12">CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION.</a></h3>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE earliest mention in print of the Cortereal voyages is found in a small collection
of travels (one of the very earliest collections made), entitled <i>Paesi novamente
retrovati</i>. This was published at Vicenza, in Italy, as the colophon states, Nov. 3, 1507,
and is supposed to have been compiled by Fracanzio da Montalboddo, or by Alessandro
Zorzi.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The account of Gaspar Cortereal is contained (book vi. chap. cxxv) in a letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
written from Lisbon, Oct. 19, 1501 (eleven days only after the return of the first vessel
which succeeded in getting home from the second voyage), by the Venetian ambassador in
Portugal, Pietro Pasqualigo, to his brothers. This is, of course, an authority of great
value. The writer gives a brief account of the voyage, speaks of the customs of the inhabitants
of the new country, and describes the captives which the ship had brought.
He says that the other vessel is expected immediately. Pasqualigo mentions, however,
only one voyage, and has apparently confused it with the earlier one; for he says that the
expedition sailed “lāno passato” (that is 1500), and writes of the failure to reach a
country discovered “lanno passato.” Perhaps he received some account of both voyages
from the mariners, and in preparing his letter failed to preserve the distinction between
them. French versions of the letter appeared in Paris in 1517 and 1522. An English translation
of the interesting portions of this letter is given in Biddle’s <i>Cabot</i>, at pp. 239, 240.</p>

<p>Another contemporary account of this voyage of Gaspar Cortereal has lately been discovered.
M. Harrisse has obtained from the archives of Modena a despatch sent to
Hercules d’Este, Duke of Ferrara, by Alberto Cantino, his representative at Lisbon, in
which the arrival of the second vessel (expected immediately in Pasqualigo’s letter) is
reported. This despatch is dated Oct. 17, 1501. The vessel arrived on the 11th,&mdash;three
days after the first one,&mdash;and brought the expected cargo of slaves. Cantino says that he
saw, touched, and surveyed (li quali io ho visti, tochi et contemplati) these natives.
He gives some account of the savages, and tells the story of the voyage as he heard the
captain of the vessel relate it to the King, being present at their interview. The caravel
had been a month on her return, and the distance was two thousand eight hundred miles,&mdash;“Questo
naviglio è venuto di la a qua in un mese, et dicono esservi 2,800 milia de distantia.”
Cantino makes no mention of the return of the first vessel, but speaks of a third,
commanded by Cortereal in person, as having decided to remain in the new country, and
to sail along its coast far enough to discover whether it were an island or <i>terra firma</i>,&mdash;“Laltro
compagno ha deliberato andar tanto per quella costa, che vole intendere se quella
è insula, o pur terra ferma.”</p>

<p>Harrisse prints this interesting letter of Cantino in his <i>Jean et Sébastian Cabot</i> (pp.
262-264). Cantino appears to have also sent his master a map showing the new discoveries.
This map Harrisse has since reproduced with a commentary, in his work on the
Cortereals, as explained in the second volume of the present history.</p>

<p>It should be noted that Harrisse counts three voyages of Gaspar Cortereal,&mdash;the first,
without result, before May, 1500; the second, between May and December of that year;
and a third, sailing in January, 1501,&mdash;the return of two of whose vessels in the following
October is related by Pasqualigo and Cantino.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>The confusion of the voyages continued. The Spanish historians and those of Italy,
knowing, perhaps, of only one, or getting their information from the <i>Paesi</i> and the maps,
speak of but one expedition. Gomara, whose work was published at Saragossa in 1552-1553,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
says that Cortereal was seeking a northwest passage, but failed to find it; that he
gave his name to the islands at the mouth of the St. Lawrence in 50° N.; and that, dismayed
at the snow and ice, he returned home with about sixty of the natives whom he
had captured.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Herrera, who published his History early in the next century,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> gets his
information from Gomara. Peter Martyr does not mention the Cortereals. Turning to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Italy, we find in Ramusio an account of Cortereal in the third volume of his great collection
of voyages,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> published in 1556, at fol. 417. Here, in an introductory discourse,
written by Ramusio himself, “sopra la terra ferme dell’ Indie Occidentali,” it is stated that
Gaspar Cortereal was the first captain who went to that part of the New World which
“runs to the north,” in 1500, with two ships, in search of a shorter passage to the Spice
Islands; that he penetrated so far north as to get into a region of great cold, discovering
at 60° a river filled with snow, which was called the “Rio Nevado;” that he found
inhabited islands to which he gave names, etc.</p>

<p>Even down to modern times the distinction between the voyages has not been recognized.
Biddle, Humboldt, and others speak of only one expedition. The Portuguese
authorities, however, are explicit in the matter. In 1563 there was published at Lisbon a
volume of navigations and discoveries written by Antonio Galvano, who had died a few
years before.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Galvano was born at Lisbon in 1503. He went, a young man, to India,
and distinguished himself there, having command of the expedition which reduced the
Moluccas to Portuguese rule, and becoming the governor of Ternate,&mdash;the largest of these
islands. He was recalled home, and coldly received by the King. Becoming indigent,
he was forced to take refuge in a hospital, where he finally died in 1557. His papers were
bequeathed to a friend, Don Francisco y Sousa Tavares, who prepared the volume for
the press. Galvano gives a good account of the expedition of Gaspar Cortereal, clearly
dividing it into two voyages; and he tells also of Miguel Cortereal’s attempt to discover
his brother’s fate. The original Portuguese text is very rare. Hakluyt published a
translation of it in 1601,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and states in his Dedication of that book to Sir Robert Cecil that
he could not succeed in finding a copy of the original. The translation was made, he
says, “by some honest and well-affected marchant of our nation, whose name by no
meanes I could attaine unto, and that, as it seemeth, many yeeres ago. For it hath lien by
me above these twelve yeeres.” In 1862 the Hakluyt Society of London reprinted this
translation under the editorial supervision of Vice-Admiral Bethune. In this edition corrections
of the English version are noted, and the whole Portuguese text is given, page for
page, from a copy of the original in the Carter-Brown Library. The passage relating to
the Cortereals is found at pages 96, 97, of this Hakluyt Society’s volume.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>The Chronicle of King Emanuel, by Damiano de Goes, appeared at Lisbon in 1565-1567.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
Goes was born in 1501, and died about 1573. He was employed in the diplomatic service
of Portugal in Flanders, Denmark, and other countries, and travelled extensively. Galvano
considered him, as a traveller, worthy of mention in his work, and says that he
visited England, France, Italy, Germany, Poland, Muscovy, and Norway. “He did see,
speake, and was conuersant with all the kings, princes, nobles, and chiefe cities of all
Christendome in the space of 22 yeeres (occupied in the work); so that by reason of the
greatnes of his trauell I thought him a man woorthie to be here remembred.”<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> He became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
afterward historiographer of Portugal, and was placed in charge of the public archives.
But he fell under the ban of the Inquisition, and died in obscurity. His account of the
Cortereals, which is clear and of great value, from the learning of the writer and from his
excellent opportunities to inform himself, is given in the sixty-seventh chapter of the first
part of the Chronicle, at pp. 87, 88.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Hieronymus Osorius (as his name is Latinized), the Bishop of Silves,&mdash;known sometimes
as the Portuguese Cicero, from the elegance of his style,&mdash;published his <i>De rebus
Emmanuelis</i> in 1571.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> He was born in 1506, and lived until 1580. His writings include
treatises on philosophy and theology, as well as works of history. In the Chronicle,
under date of 1503, he gives a full account of the Cortereal voyages, including the search
expedition sent out by the King that year, and the proposition of the eldest brother to
equip a new exploration. The story may be found at p. 63 of the edition of 1586.</p>

<p>Oscar Peschel and Friedrich Kunstmann, in Germany, used these Portuguese authorities
freely in their accounts of the Cortereals. Peschel’s book, an excellent one, <i>Geschichte
des Zeitalters der Entdeckungen</i>, was published at Stuttgart in 1858, and went to a second
edition in 1877. The discoveries of the Portuguese are treated in the ninth chapter of the
second book.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Kunstmann’s work, of great learning and research, <i>Die Entdeckung
Amerikas</i>, was published at Munich in 1859 by the Royal Bavarian Academy of Sciences,
as part of the centennial commemoration (March 28, 1859) of its foundation. In addition
to the printed authorities, Kunstmann instituted searches among the manuscript archives
at Lisbon. He had the pretended early voyage of Joâo Vaz Cortereal examined, and
ascertained that there was no foundation for it.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> He found the letter of Miguel Cortereal,
written Aug. 6, 1501, to Christovâo Lopez, which has been used in the preceding narrative;
and that brother’s agreement with the King, Jan. 15, 1502, by which the grant
previously made to Gaspar was continued to Miguel.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>An excellent account of the Cortereal voyages, based largely upon Kunstmann’s researches,
is given by Dr. Kohl in the fifth chapter of his <i>Discovery of Maine</i>.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> At the
first session of the International Congress of “Américanistes,” held at Nancy in July, 1875,
M. Luciano Cordeiro, professor in the Institut at Coïmbre, presented, through M. Lucien
Adam, an elaborate essay on the share of the Portuguese in the discovery of America.
M. Cordeiro’s paper shows great industry and research, but it should be read with
caution, as his patriotism sometimes exceeds his discretion. He looks at everything
with the distorted vision of an enthusiastic lover of his native land.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>With Kunstmann’s <i>Entdeckung</i>, the Bavarian Academy published, under the care of
that gentleman, Karl von Spruner, and Georg M. Thomas, an elegant atlas of thirteen maps
in beautifully executed colored fac-similes. Portions of three of these maps relating to the
Cortereals are given in a greatly reduced form, without the brilliant colors, by Dr. Kohl,
in the Appendage to his chapter on these navigators. The first of these is a Portuguese
chart, made about 1504 by an unknown hand. The southern part of Greenland is laid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
down upon it without a name; and farther to the west appears a considerable extent of
country, answering, perhaps, to parts of our Labrador and Newfoundland, which bears the
name “Terra de cortte Reall.”<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The second chart, made by Pedro Reinel at about the
same period, shows only Portuguese names and gives the Portuguese flag on that part of
America visited by the Cortereals. Reinel was a Portuguese pilot of eminence, who afterward
entered the Spanish service. The third map, also of Portuguese origin, of about the
year 1520, although its exact date and its author’s name are unknown, contains at Labrador
these words: “terram istam portugalenses viderunt atamen non intraverunt” (“The
Portuguese saw this country, but did not enter it”); and again at a place farther west
occurs the legend: “Terram istam gaspar corte Regalis portugalensis primo invenit, et
secum tulit hōīes silvestres et ursos albos. In ea est maxiā multitudo animalium et avium
necnon et pescium. qui anno sequenti naufragium perpessus nunquam rediit: sic et fratri
ejus micaeli anno sequenti contigit” (“This country was first discovered by Gaspar
Cortereal, a Portuguese, and he brought from there wild and barbarous men and white
bears. There are to be found in it plenty of animals, birds, and fish. In the following
year he was shipwrecked, and did not return: the same happened to his brother Michael
in the next year”).<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p class="p2">The original authorities for the early French expeditions have, unhappily, not been
preserved, or they still lie hidden in some dusky receptacle, baffling all search for
them. The Breton fishermen perhaps wrote no accounts of their voyages across the
Atlantic; but we might hope for some authentic reports of the voyages of Denys, Aubert,
and others, made under the auspices of the rich and powerful Angos. The archives of
Dieppe, however, were destroyed at the bombardment of that town in 1694, and those
of La Rochelle met a similar fate.</p>

<p>The earliest mention of these transatlantic voyages that we now find occurs in a discourse
attributed to a great French captain of Dieppe, preserved in an Italian translation
by Ramusio, in his collection of voyages.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> This discourse gives a summary description
of the new countries, and a very brief mention of their discoverers. From internal evidence
it appears to have been written in 1539. Ramusio, in introducing it, expresses his
regret that he could not ascertain the name of its author. M. Louis Estancelin published
in 1832 a journal of the voyage made by Jean Parmentier to Sumatra in 1529, which corresponds
so exactly with the details of a similar voyage in the great captain’s discourse as
to make it evident that Parmentier was the person described by Ramusio under that title.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
This discourse mentions the voyages of Denys and Aubert, and speaks of Verrazano as
the discoverer of Norumbega. From this source other writers have generally drawn their
authority for these early voyages. The Chronicle of Eusebius,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> however, contains an
account of the visit of American savages to Rouen in 1509; and there is a curious bas-relief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
over a tomb in the Church of St. Jacques at Dieppe, in which American natives are
represented.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Charlevoix speaks of the map which Jean Denys is said to have made.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>The authorities for the voyage of Verrazano are two copies of his letter, written to the
King of France from Dieppe July 8, 1524, on his return from the voyage. Both of these
are, however, Italian translations of the letter, the original of which does not exist. One
was printed by Ramusio in 1556, in the third volume of his collection of voyages.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> The
other was found many years later in the Strozzi Library (the historical documents in which
were afterward transferred to the Magliabechian, now merged in the National Library) in
Florence, and was first published in 1841 by the New York Historical Society, with a
translation made by Dr. J. G. Cogswell.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> This contained a Cosmographical Appendix not
in the copy printed by Ramusio. The earlier printed version was translated into English
by Hakluyt for his <i>Divers Voyages</i>, which appeared in London in 1582, and was incorporated
by him into his larger collection published in 1600.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Dr. Cogswell’s translation was
reprinted in London by Dr. Asher in his <i>Henry Hudson the Navigator</i>, prepared for the
Hakluyt Society in 1860.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Dr. Asher considers the Cosmographical Appendix a document
of great importance. With this Strozzi copy there was found a letter written by one
Fernando Carli from Lyons, Aug. 4, 1524, to his father in Florence, accounting for sending
Verrazano’s letter, which Carli thought would interest his countrymen. This letter of
Carli was first printed in 1844, with the essay of George W. Greene on Verrazano, in the
<i>Saggiatore</i> (i. 257), a Roman journal of history and philology. Professor Greene, who
was the American Consul at Rome, had been instrumental in obtaining the Verrazano
letter for the New York Society, and had previously published his essay in the <i>North
American Review</i> for October, 1837. He reprinted it in his <i>Historical Studies</i>. Carli’s
letter may be consulted in English translations in Mr. Smith’s, Mr. Murphy’s, and Mr.
Brevoort’s essays on Verrazano.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>References to the voyage occur occasionally in French, English, and Spanish authors;<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
and it was not until within a few years that any doubt was thrown upon the authenticity
of the narrative.</p>

<p>In October, 1864, Mr. Buckingham Smith, an accomplished scholar, who had been secretary
of the American Legation at Madrid, read a paper upon this subject before the New
York Historical Society, afterward published the same year under the title, <i>An Inquiry
into the Authenticity of Documents concerning a Discovery in North America claimed
to have been made by Verrazzano</i>. Mr. Smith’s death interrupted an enlarged and revised
edition of this essay, which he was urged to prepare.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Mr. J. Carson Brevoort presented
a paper on Verrazano, taking an opposite view, to the American Geographical Society,
in 1871, which he printed three years later, entitled <i>Verrazano the Navigator</i>.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> This was
followed by the appearance, in 1875, of Mr. Henry C. Murphy’s <i>The Voyage of Verrazzano</i>,
in which he makes an able plea against the genuineness of the accounts of the voyage.
This book caused considerable discussion, and has been answered several times. It
remains, I think, the last word on that side of the question,&mdash;except that Mr. Bancroft
has omitted all notice of Verrazano in the revised edition of his <i>History of the United
States</i>, and the editors of Appleton’s <i>American Cyclopædia</i> seem to adopt Mr. Murphy’s
conclusions. Mr. Murphy’s book was reviewed by Harrisse in the <i>Revue critique</i> for
Jan. 1, 1876, and his conclusions were accepted with some reserve. It was noticed unfavorably
by Mr. Major in the London <i>Geographical Magazine</i> (iii. 186) for July, 1876 (copied
from the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i> of May 26, 1876), and by the Rev. B. F. De Costa in the <i>American
Church Review</i> of the same date. In 1878-1879 papers on this subject by De Costa
appeared in the <i>Magazine of American History</i>, which were afterward collected and
revised by their author, and issued, with the title, <i>Verrazano the Explorer</i>, in 1881. This
work contains an exhaustive bibliography of the subject, to which reference should be
made.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> In this same year, 1881, M. Cornelio Desimoni, vice-president of the “Società
Ligure di Storia Patria,” printed in the fifteenth volume of the <i>Atti</i> of that Society a second
<i>Studio</i> on Verrazano, in which he takes strong ground in favor of the genuineness
of the voyage. This essay had been presented to the third congress of “Américanistes,”
which met at Brussels in 1879. M. Desimoni had previously contributed to the <i>Archivio
Storico Italiano</i> for August, 1877, an article upon this navigator,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> but was able to review
Mr. Murphy’s book only from notices he had seen of it. In a note at the end of his
paper he states that he had procured a copy, and, so far from finding any reason to modify
the views he had expressed, he thought that he could find in Mr. Murphy’s essay additional
arguments for the authenticity of the voyage. The second <i>Studio</i> was followed by
what M. Desimoni modestly calls a <i>Third Appendix</i> (the <i>Studio</i> having two Appendices
printed with it). This is a paper of considerable importance, as it contains the reproduction
of the map of which I shall speak later.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>Hieronimo da Verrazano, the brother of the navigator, made about 1529 a large <i>mappamundi</i>,
on which the discoveries of Giovanni are laid down.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> This map is preserved in the
Borgiano Museum of the College “di Propaganda Fide” in Rome. It is not certain that
the map is an original; and it was first mentioned by Von Murr in his <i>Behaim</i>, Gotha,
1801, p. 28, referring to a letter of Cardinal Borgia of Jan. 31, 1795, regarding it. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
was again referred to in Millin’s <i>Magazin encyclopédique</i>, vol. lxviii. (1807); but general
attention was first directed to it by M. Thomassy in 1852, in a communication published
in the <i>Nouvelles Annales des Voyages</i>.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Mr. Brevoort<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> has given a description of it,
which he prepared from two photographs, much reduced in size, made for the American
Geographical Society in 1871. These photographs were not large enough nor sufficiently
distinct to allow the names of places on the American coast to be read. This North
American section of the map was first given with the names by Dr. De Costa, who had
made a careful examination of the original during a visit to Rome, in the <i>Magazine of
American History</i> for August, 1878.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>This map is not dated; but the following legend, placed at the position of Verrazano’s
discoveries, fixes the date for 1529: “Verrazana sive nova gallia quale discoprì 5 anni fa
giovanni da verrazano fiorentino per ordine e Comandamento del Cristianissimo Re di
Francia” (“Verrazana, or New Gaul, which was discovered five years ago by Giovanni
di Verrazano, of Florence, by the order and command of the most Christian King of
France”).</p>

<p>One of the most interesting of the maps which show the traces and influence of Verrazano’s
voyage is the copper globe known as the globe of Ulpius, from its maker,
Euphrosynus Ulpius, constructed (as appears by an inscription on it) in 1542. This
was found in Spain by the late Buckingham Smith, and bought for the New York Historical
Society in 1859 by Mr. John D. Wolfe. Mr. Smith prepared a paper on this
globe, which was printed, with a map of the portion relating to North America, in the
<i>Historical Magazine</i> in 1862.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Dr. De Costa published, in the <i>Magazine of American
History</i> for January, 1879, an excellent account of the globe of Ulpius, with a representation
of one hemisphere, which, he says, “without being a fac-simile, is nevertheless
sufficiently correct for historical purposes, and may be relied upon.”<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> On this globe,
between Florida and the “Regio Baccalearum,” we find this inscription, covering a large
extent of territory: “Verrazana sive Nova Gallia a Verrazano Florentino comperta anno
Sal MD.” (“Verrazana, or New Gaul, discovered by Verrazano the Florentine, in the year
of Salvation MD.”). It will be observed that the date has been left incomplete.</p>

<p>Other maps showing traces of Verrazano’s voyage are enumerated by Kohl, Brevoort,
and De Costa, the account by the last-named being the latest, and perhaps the most
complete.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p class="p2">The controversy about this letter and voyage of Verrazano has excited so much interest,
that it is well to give a concise summary of Mr. Murphy’s objections to the genuineness
of the voyage, and to consider with equal brevity some of the replies to these
objections, and the additional evidence for the support of the narrative which has been
discovered since the date of Mr. Murphy’s essay.</p>

<p>The conclusions which Mr. Murphy seeks to establish are set forth in the following
<i>brief</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“That the letter, according to the evidence upon which its existence is predicated, could not
have been written by Verrazzano; that the instrumentality of the King of France in any such expedition
of discovery as therein described is unsupported by the history of that country, and is inconsistent
with the acknowledged acts of Francis and his successors, and therefore incredible; and that
its description of the coast and some of the physical characteristics of the people and of the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
are essentially false, and prove that the writer could not have made them from his own personal
knowledge and experience, as pretended; and, in conclusion, it will be shown that its apparent
knowledge of the direction and extent of the coast was derived from the exploration of Estévan
Gomez, a Portuguese pilot in the service of the King of Spain; and that Verrazzano, at the time
of his pretended discovery, was actually engaged in a corsairial expedition, sailing under the
French flag, in a different part of the ocean.”<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p class="p1">Mr. Murphy argues, first, that the letter is not genuine, because no original has ever
“been exhibited, or referred to in any contemporary or later historian as being in existence;
and, although it falls within the era of modern history, not a single fact which it
professes to describe relating to the fitting out of the expedition, the voyage, or the
discovery, is corroborated by other testimony, whereby its genuineness might even be
inferred.”<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> He considers it “highly improbable” that there could have been a French
original of the letter, from which two translations were made, with an interval of twenty-seven
years between them, “and yet no copy of it in French, or any memorial of its
existence in that language, be known.”<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> As the Carli copy contains a Cosmographical
Appendix not in the Ramusio text, Mr. Murphy assumes that Ramusio took his version
from the Carli manuscript, revising it, and changing its language to suit his editorial
taste. Later in his book he goes farther, and accuses Ramusio of suppressing a fact
here and adding another there, to make the Verrazano narrative agree with other documents
in his possession. As Carli’s letter to his father covered his copy of Verrazano’s
letter, the inquiry is narrowed down to a question of the authenticity of the Carli letter.
Mr. Murphy argues that this letter cannot be genuine, because it was written by an
obscure person, at a great distance from the French Court, and from Dieppe (the port
from which Verrazano wrote), only twenty-seven days after the date of the letter which
it pretended to enclose.</p>

<p>Mr. Murphy, in the next division of his argument, asserts that no such voyage was
made for the King of France:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Neither the letter, nor any document, chronicle, memoir, or history of any kind, public or
private, printed or in manuscript, belonging to that period or the reign of Francis I., who then
bore the crown, mentioning or in any manner referring to it, or to the voyage and discovery, has
ever been found in France; and neither Francis himself, nor any of his successors, ever acknowledged
or in any manner recognized such discovery, or asserted under it any right to the possession
of the country; but, on the contrary, both he and they ignored it, in undertaking colonization in
that region, by virtue of other discoveries made under their authority, or with their permission by
their subjects.”<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p class="p1">He claims that the accounts of Verrazano’s voyage given by French historians all show
internal evidence that the information was derived from Ramusio. The life of Francis I.,
he further says, is a complete denial of the assertion that Verrazano’s voyage was made by
his direction. Francis sent out the expeditions of Cartier and of Roberval, and yet never
recognized the discovery made by Verrazano. And the map, sometimes called that of
Henry II. (the date of which, however, has been supposed to be some years earlier than
the accession of that monarch in 1547), an official map displaying all the knowledge the
French Court possessed of the American coast, is destitute of any trace of Verrazano.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Murphy considers next what he calls the misrepresentations in the letter in regard
to the geography of the coast. Only to one place, an island, is a name given. A very
noticeable omission is that of the Chesapeake Bay, which could not have been overlooked
by an explorer seeking a passage to Cathay; and not even the named island really
exists: there is none on the coast answering its description.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>He next undertakes to show that the letter claims the discovery of Cape Breton and
the southerly coast of Newfoundland; and that Ramusio, knowing this claim to be false,
“deliberately” interpolated into his text a clause to limit Verrazano’s discoveries to the
point where those of the Bretons began.</p>

<p>Mr. Murphy argues next that “the description of the people and productions of the
land [were] not made from the personal observation of the writer of the letter. What
distinctively belonged to the natives is unnoticed, and what is originally mentioned of
them is untrue.”<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> He thinks that all the details given of Indian manners and customs
may have been copied from well-known narratives of other visits to other parts of America,
and instances a source whence they may have been drawn. Fault is found with
Verrazano’s letter because it neglects to mention such peculiarities of the Indians as
wampum, tobacco, and, “most remarkable omission of all,” the bark canoe. The falsity
of the narrative, made probable by these omissions, is rendered certain by the positive
statement of a radical difference in complexion between the tribes found in different parts
of the country.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> And, again, the condition in which plants and vegetation are described
is equally absurd and preposterous. And so both in the case of the color of the natives
and in that of the conditions of the grapes, Ramusio, says Mr. Murphy, is obliged to alter
the text of the narrative to make these stories probable.</p>

<p>The extrinsic evidence in support of the Verrazano discovery is next considered. As
Mr. Murphy knew this evidence, it consisted of two pieces,&mdash;the Verrazano map, and the
discourse of the great French sea-captain. The map was known, at the time of the
printing of Mr. Murphy’s essay, only by description and by two inadequate photographs.
Our present information about this map is so much greater, that Mr. Murphy’s account
of it may be passed over until the map itself is described, later. The French captain’s
discourse is known only in the Italian translation printed by Ramusio, and placed in his
third volume, immediately after the Verrazano letter. Mr. Murphy dismisses this piece
of evidence with few words. Finding in the discourse a clause relating to Verrazano, he
at once concludes that Ramusio interpolated it, to make this document consistent with the
letter.</p>

<p>A skilled advocate, after proving to his own satisfaction the falsity of a document,
likes to find some genuine story which may have served the concocters of the falsehood
as a model and storehouse for their lies. He wants also to complete his case by showing
the motive for the forgery. This motive Mr. Murphy finds in the civic pride of Florence.
All the evidence in favor of the story is traceable, he says, to Florence. As for the model
and source of the letter, he discovers these in an attempt “to appropriate to a Florentine
the glory which belonged to Estévan Gomez, a Portuguese pilot ... in the service of the
Emperor.” He gives the voyage of Gomez in pretty full details. The landfall occurred
on the coast of South Carolina. Thence he ran the coast northwardly to Cape Breton,
where he turned and retraced his track as far as Florida, returning to Spain by way of
Cuba. Mr. Murphy brings forward the map of Ribero, made in 1529, which he claims as
an official exhibition of the discoveries of Gomez, and which he thinks was used in the
construction of the Verrazano letter, because the several courses and distances run, as
described in the letter, agree with similar divisions on the map.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Murphy adds a concluding chapter, in which he gives the true history of the life
of Verrazano, as he gathers it from authentic sources. Beyond his birth and parentage
nothing is perhaps certainly known, except his career as a French corsair, under the name
of Juan Florin or Florentin. In this capacity he made several rich captures from the
Spanish and Portuguese, notably the treasure sent home by Cortes in 1523. Mr. Murphy
thinks that a passage in a letter of the Portuguese ambassador in France, which appears
to refer to preparations for a voyage of discovery about this time, is really an allusion to
the proposed raid, the other being used by the French as a cloak or cover. At all events,
he says, Verrazano cannot have been in two places at once,&mdash;on the coast of America, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
on his return from Newfoundland to France, and at the same time have taken a ship on
her way from the Indies to Portugal. He cites, as authority for this <i>alibi</i>, a statement
of the capture of a treasure ship brought by a courier from Portugal, and mentioned in
a letter of Peter Martyr, dated August 3, 1524.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Mr. Murphy then closes with an account
of the capture and execution of Florin, or Verrazano.</p>

<p>Mr. Murphy’s argument is an ingenious and able one; and the book, having never
been published, is not within the reach of all.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>To the objections named in the first divisions of Mr. Murphy’s argument,&mdash;that the
letter could not have been written by Verrazano, and that no such voyage or discovery was
made for the King of France,&mdash;replies suggest themselves very easily. We have no
originals of many important documents, and yet do not doubt their general accuracy,&mdash;the
letters of Columbus and Vespucius, for instance; the original French of Ribault; and,
to come closer to Mr. Murphy, where is the report of Gomez’ voyage? There is none;
and its only supports are an occasional not too flattering reference in the historians, and
a map made by another hand. The despised voyage of Verrazano rests upon both a
personal narrative and a map, the work of a brother.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Murphy himself furnishes corroborative testimony to the probable truth of Verrazano’s
voyage. He cites a passage from Andrade’s Chronicle of John III., then King of
Portugal. By this it appears that John learned that one “Joâo Varezano, a Florentine,”
had offered to the King of France to “discover other kingdoms in the East which the
Portuguese had not found, and that in the ports of Normandy a fleet was being made
ready under the favor of the admirals of the coast and the dissimulation of Francis, to
colonize the land of Santa Cruz, called Brazil,” etc. The Portuguese King lost no time in
sending a special ambassador, João da Silveyra, to remonstrate; and Mr. Murphy prints
a letter from him to his sovereign, dated April 25, 1523, in which he says: “By what
I hear, Maestro Joâo Verazano, who is going on the discovery of Cathay, has not left
up to this date for want of opportunity, and because of differences, I understand, between
himself and men; and on this topic, though knowing nothing positively, I have
written my doubts in accompanying letters. I shall continue to doubt, unless he take his
departure.”<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>His Appendix contains also the agreement made by Admiral Chabot with Verrazano
and others to “equip, victual, and fit three vessels to make the voyage for spices to the
Indies.” Of this expedition Verrazano was to be chief pilot. Chabot was created admiral
in March, 1526, which settles the date of this agreement. All these documents Mr.
Murphy is obliged to twist into attempts to cover attacks on Spanish or Portuguese commerce
by pretended voyages to the West. Is it not easier to take the simple meaning
which they carry on their face? This agreement with the Admiral is supported by two
documents first printed by M. Harrisse.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> In the first Giovanni appoints his brother Jerome
his attorney during the voyage to the Indies; the second is an agreement with one Adam
Godefroy, <i>bourgeois</i> of Rouen, in reference to some trading contemplated in the voyage.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
Dr. De Costa brings forward also another document relating to Verrazano, dated “the last
day of September, 1525,” found in the archives of Rouen; and M. Margry states that he
has a letter written at Paris, Nov. 14, 1527, in which Verrazano is said to be preparing to
visit America with five ships.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> And here, too, a reference should be made to the visit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Verrazano to England with some map or globe, as mentioned more than once by
Hakluyt.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>There is yet hope that the original of the Verrazano letter may be discovered. Dr.
De Costa thinks that he has evidence of its probable existence at one time in Spain; and
also that it was used by Allefonsce in 1545,&mdash;eleven years before the publication by
Ramusio.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> There certainly seems no greater improbability in the supposition of two independent
translations, Carli’s and Ramusio’s, from a single original, now lost, than in the
assumption that Ramusio rewrote the Carli text and omitted the cosmographical appendix.
Indeed Mr. Murphy’s charge, renewed at intervals in his essay as his theory of the
fabrication of the letter requires,&mdash;that Ramusio was guilty of almost fraudulent editing,&mdash;has
no foundation. The reputation of the Italian editor stands too high to be easily
assailed; and as he was not a Florentine, motive for the deceit is lacking. A careful collation
of the verbal differences between the versions is said to support the theory that they
are separate translations of one original.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> And M. Desimoni, presumably an exact
scholar of his own language, asserts that a philological examination of the two texts shows
that, if either is a <i>rimaneggiato</i> (worked over) copy, it is Carli’s, and not Ramusio’s.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>As to the genuineness of Carli’s letter to his father, the epistle contains a reference to
the expected arrival of the King at Lyons, fixing its date, and giving thereby internal evidence
of its reality. There is really no improbability in the statement that Verrazano had
sent a copy of his letter to the Lyons merchants, and it is very easy to suppose Carli in
the employ, or enjoying the friendship, of one or more of these merchants. The government
of France had not been extended over the seaports long enough to make it any
breach of privilege to communicate the results of a voyage to others than the King. And,
as Mr. Major observes, in regard to the great distance between Dieppe and Lyons, “it
would be a poor courier who could not compass that distance in twenty-seven days.”<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

     <div class="cf"><p class="pc200">AN AUTOGRAPH OF FRANCIS I.</p>
</div></div>

<p>A reason for the failure of the Verrazano letter to make any impression on the French
King, or to influence his subsequent action in reference to American discoveries and
colonization, is found in the peculiar circumstances of Francis at this time. Engaged in
constant wars, almost from the date of his accession to the throne, he was, in the summer
of 1524, hurrying south to defend Provence from the attack of the Constable de Bourbon
and the Marquis of Pescara, who had obtained permission of Charles V. to invade it.
Many towns, the capital, Aix, among them, soon submitted to the Imperial forces; Marseilles
was hotly besieged, and only relieved by the close approach of Francis with his
army. Now the Queen-Mother was renamed Regent of France, and the war transferred
to Italy, where, at the battle of Pavia, Feb.
24, 1525, Francis was defeated and taken
prisoner. The following year was spent in
captivity in Spain. On his release he at once
broke his plighted faith, to renew the bitter
struggle with the Emperor. For the time
there could be thought or plans for nothing
but war. Verrazano and his discovery were
entirely forgotten at Court.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>To Mr. Murphy’s objections founded on
the misrepresentations of the coast geography,
and the mistakes and omissions in the
description of the people, contained in the
letter, it is sufficient to answer that that gentleman mistakes the character of the letter, and
demands more from it than he has a right to expect. “We do not quite see,” says Mr.
Major, “why the first description of a country should be the only one expected to be free
from imperfections.”<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> All the accounts of the early visits to this country have mixed with
the general truth of the narrative more or less absurd and improbable statements. Dr.
Kohl says: “It is well known that the old navigators in these western countries very
often saw what they wished to see.”<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> As for the omission to notice the Chesapeake
Bay, and to describe wampum, tobacco, and the bark-canoe, others besides Verrazano
have been guilty of the same offence.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>The Verrazano letter should be regarded, not as an exact, well-digested report of the
voyage (such as a modern explorer might make), but rather as the first hasty announcement
to the King of his return and of the success of the voyage. It should be remembered
also that mention is made in it of a “little book,” called by Dr. Kohl “the most
precious part of what Verrazano wrote respecting his voyage,”<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> wherein were noted the
observations of longitude and latitude, of the currents, ebb and flood of the sea, and of
other matters which he hoped might be serviceable to navigators. These and other notes
were doubtless used by the brother, Hieronimo, in making his map, and the abundance of
names displayed on that map is a reply to Mr. Murphy’s objection that the letter contains
but one name,&mdash;the Island of Louise.</p>

<p>I shall enumerate the authorities for the voyage of Gomez later in this essay; but as
Mr. Murphy finds in it the source of the forged Verrazano letter, something must be said
of it here. First, it is to be noticed that while Mr. Murphy refuses the narrative of Verrazano’s
voyage utterly, he finds no difficulty in accepting one of Gomez’ which is to
a great degree of his own (Murphy’s) construction. Dr. Kohl and other scholars have
found it impossible to decide with any certainty as to the extent and direction of this
voyage. Mr. Murphy presents us with full details,&mdash;a landfall in South Carolina; a
coasting voyage to the north as far as Cape Breton, a careful observation on the return of
rivers, capes, and bays; a temporary belief that he had found the strait he was seeking in
the Penobscot, or “Rio de los Gamos,” on account of the great tide issuing from it, and
a return to Spain by way of Cuba. The authorities cited in support of these statements
are Peter Martyr’s <i>Decades</i>, Herrera, and Cespedes’ <i>Yslario general</i>,&mdash;the last in manuscript.
The extracts from Martyr and Herrera I have reserved for another part of this
chapter.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> They do not support Mr. Murphy’s details. The Cespedes manuscript was
the subject of some remarks by Mr. Buckingham Smith before the New York Historical
Society, briefly reported in the <i>Historical Magazine</i>.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Mr. Smith had not been able to
find this manuscript, but understood that it contained a full account of the voyage of
Gomez. Mr. Murphy’s note shows that he knew of its existence in the National Library
at Madrid. The director of that library has examined this manuscript at the request of
Harrisse, and has not found in it any report of the voyage of Gomez by the navigator,
nor does it contain any detailed account of the expedition. There is a reference which
shows, perhaps, that Cespedes had seen one of Gomez’ writings.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>The attempt to derive the Verrazano letter from the voyage of Gomez is called by
Mr. Major the “climax of the series of Mr. Murphy’s constructive imputations.”<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> His
elaborate comparison of the courses of Verrazano with similar divisions on Ribero’s map
is open to serious question. There are no such divisions on the map. He argues from a
knowledge of the two extreme terms of Verrazano’s voyage, and neglects the intermediate
term, the latitude of the harbor where the explorers spent fifteen days, doubtless the most
accurate latitude taken. And even at the close of his comparison he allows that the latitudes
of Ribero’s map are wrong, and says that the map does not give a faithful representation
of the voyage of Gomez. It does not give by name the “Rio de los Gamos” which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Cespedes says Gomez discovered, although that estuary was already drawn, in the same
form given to it by Ribero, on the earlier Weimar map of 1527, which map omits the name
of Gomez altogether.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>The passage from one of Peter Martyr’s letters, which Mr. Murphy cites to prove that
Verrazano was capturing a Portuguese vessel at the time when the letter claimed him as
making discoveries, is not very conclusive. Mr. Major thinks that there was time for
him to have run down from Dieppe, after his return to that port, to the coast of Portugal,
attracted by so rich a game as one hundred and eighty thousand ducats. But Martyr’s
statement is indefinite. There are no particulars of time or place, when or where the
treasure was taken. It is not even certain that the news brought by the courier was more
than a rumor. Martyr’s language is: “Ad aliud hac, iter fecit regis Portugalliæ cursor,
quod Florinus pyrata Gallus nauim regi suo raptauerit ab Indis venientem, qua merces
vehebãtur gemmarum et aromatum ad ducatorum centum octoginta millium summam
conqueritur.”<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>The map of Hieronimo da Verrazano is without doubt the strongest support of the
letter and voyage of his brother Giovanni. That these persons were brothers appears
from a document dated May 11, 1526, whereby the navigator constitutes “Jarosme de
Varasenne, son frère et heritier,” his attorney to act for him during a proposed voyage
to the Indies. This paper, first printed by M. Harrisse in 1876, is signed “Janus Verrazanus.”
Dr. De Costa gives a fac-simile of this signature,&mdash;here reproduced,&mdash;the
only known autograph of Verrazano.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Brevoort gives perhaps the best description of the map, and I condense the following
from his account of it. The map is on three sheets of parchment, pasted together,
and is 260 centimetres long and 130 wide (about 102 inches by 51), its length being just
double the width. It is well preserved, somewhat stained; but no part, except coast-names,
is indistinct. Its projection is the simple cylindrical square one, in which all the degrees
of latitude are made equal to each other and to the equatorial ones. Like other maps
of its period, it has the equator drawn below the middle of the map, and shows 90° of latitude
north, and 64° south of it. In breadth it represents about 320° of longitude. There
is no graduation for longitude; but the meridians that cross the centres and sides of the
two great circles of windroses appear to be drawn seventy degrees apart. There is the
usual network of cross-lines radiating from windroses, with one great central rose in
north latitude 16°. From the centre of each rose thirty-two lines are drawn to the points
of the compass, and these lines are prolonged to the margin of the map. One meridian is
divided into degrees of latitude of equal size, each one numbered. Close to the upper
margin there is a small scale, with a legend explaining that from point to point there are
twelve and a half leagues, each of four miles. The scale is equal to eighteen degrees
of latitude in length, and is subdivided into six parts, each having four divisions or
points.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Brevoort next gives a careful account of the representation of different parts of
the world upon this map. Passing somewhat rapidly over the eastern hemisphere, which
appears to be generally drawn from the most recent authorities, he takes up the western
in some detail. The latitudes of the map are wrong; all the West India Islands are
placed several degrees too high, thus forcing northward all other places. Verrazano’s
landfall, for instance, is here indicated at about 42°, instead of 34°, as stated in the letter.
With this correction the map shows the American coast with some approach to accuracy.
Three French standards<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> are placed (according to Brevoort) on the territory claimed as
Verrazano’s discovery,&mdash;one at the southern and one at the northern limit, with the third
at the place where the explorers spent fifteen days. Over these three flags appears the
inscription, in capital letters, “NOVA GALLIA SIVE IUCATANET,” and the legend,
already cited, “<span class="smcap">VERRAZANA SIVE NOVA GALLIA</span>,” etc.</p>

<p>Mr. Brevoort has industriously collected the scanty references to this map after it became
the property of Cardinal Borgia, with whose collection it was bequeathed to the Propaganda
in 1804; but he has been unable to discover the time when the Cardinal procured it, and the
source whence it came to his collection. Nothing, indeed, is known of its early history.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>Dr. De Costa devotes a chapter of his book to the map of Hieronimo. After showing
that the map-maker and the navigator were brothers, he proceeds to consider the genesis
of the map, and finds the beginning of its North American portion in the Lorraine map,
published in the Ptolemy of 1513. The latitudes of the Verrazano map are recognized
as erroneous, and the observer is warned to disregard them. “When this is done, the
student will have no difficulty in recognizing the outlines of the North Atlantic coast.
For general correctness, the delineation is not equalled by any map of the sixteenth century.”
Prominent places are identified and named.</p>

<p>The influence of this map upon subsequent ones is next considered, and a long list
of maps showing this influence is cited. Dr. De Costa adds to the value of his discussion
by giving tracings from several of these maps, with fac-similes of the Verrazano map,
and an enlarged drawing of its coast-line.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> But the strong point of his chapter, and that
for which he deserves the greatest credit, is the publication of a sketch of Verrazano’s
coast of the United States, with the names of places attached. These names he deciphered
from the original map during a late visit to Rome. They are, of course, of the
greatest value in any future study of the map. Dr. De Costa enters somewhat into a
study of these names.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>M. Desimoni, while generally acknowledging his indebtedness to Dr. De Costa’s
work, and praising that gentleman’s scholarship and research, could not accept all his
inferences in the matter of the names, and doubted some of his readings. He therefore
caused a fresh examination of the map to be made, through the kind and learned services
of Dr. Giacomo Lumbroso and Canon Fabiani. He prints, in the Appendix to his <i>Studio
secondo</i> on Verrazano, in parallel columns, the variations from De Costa’s readings. The
great difficulty and doubt attending the deciphering words, particularly names, in old
documents and maps, is well known to all who have attempted such work.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>A discovery made lately at Milan brings out a new map, and one of great value in the
discussion of Verrazano’s voyage. M. Desimoni, on his return to Genoa from the
Geographical Congress held at Venice in September, 1881, stopped at Milan, where he
visited the Ambrosian Library to consult some maps. He was there told by the <i>prefetto</i>,
the Abbé Ceriani, that a map by Vesconte Maggiolo, hitherto supposed to bear the date
of 1587, and therefore to have been the work of one of the second generation of this
family of map-makers, was really dated 1527. By comparing the legend on this map with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
one of similar form and writing on a map of 1524, it could be seen that the numeral 2 in
the first map had become an 8 by lengthening the curves of the figure until they were
finally joined. This appeared to have been done with ink of a paler color. M. Desimoni
reproduces the two legends, to show the process.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> He finds also certain peculiarities in the
map, supposed of 1587, which prove that it must belong to the first decades of the century,
and therefore entertains no doubt of the correctness of the change in the date.</p>

<p>Fresh from studies of early American voyages, M. Desimoni examined the North American
portion of this map, particularly the coast, with as great care as his limited time and the
poor condition of the parchment permitted. He was not a little surprised to find that the
coast bore names closely related both to the Verrazano and to other maps whose source is
yet undiscovered. He made a copy of the names, and afterward submitted his work to Signor
Carlo Prayer, of Milan, who verified it, and also furnished as perfect a copy as it was
possible to make of the names, and a sketch of the whole coast. This was reproduced by
M. Desimoni to illustrate a paper prepared for the Società Ligure di’ Storia Patria.</p>

<p>This map measures about seventy-five centimetres in length by about fifty in width,&mdash;about
29½ inches by 19½. Its legend reads: “Vesconte de Maiollo conposuy hanc
cartam in Janua anno d̄ny. 1527, die xx Decenbris.” The place occupied in the Verrazano
map by the title <span class="smcap">Nova Gallia</span>, etc., and the legend about Verrazano’s discovery, bears in
this map the name <span class="smcap">Francesca</span>, to indicate exactly a name for the whole region.</p>

<p>There is no mention of Verrazano by name in this map, but there is ample evidence
of a connection between Maggiolo’s map and that of Hieronimo da Verrazano; very
probably, M. Desimoni thinks, through the intervention or medium of some chart or
charts yet unknown. The Maggiolo map has a reference to Florence, Verrazano’s birthplace,
in the names of “Valle unbrosa” (Vallambrosa), “Careggi,” etc.; references to
France and Francis in such names as “Anguileme,” “Longavilla,” “Normanvilla,”
“Diepa,” “San Germano,” and others, particularly “Luisa,” applied to an island. The
map is connected with Verrazano’s, not only by this name, but by a great number which the
two have in common. It is true that these names are not always applied to the same
positions on the two maps: “Luisa” is a squarish island on the Maggiolo map, and a triangular
one on the other, and in the letter. The latitudes of Maggiolo’s map are different.
Florida is placed as far south as the tropic. There is naturally some diversity in the
general direction of the coast, and in the distances from place to place. But the substantial
points are equivalent, if not identical. We have the <span class="smcap">Nova Gallia</span> in its equivalent,
<span class="smcap">Francesca</span>; the same allusions in the names to Tuscany, France, Dieppe; and an
identity in the names of three very important places,&mdash;“Luisa,” the port of refuge, and
the attempt to show Cape Cod.</p>

<p>M. Desimoni examines again the map of Gastoldo, first published in the Ptolemy
of 1548, inserted later in Ramusio’s third volume, and the globe known as the globe
of Ulpius, already mentioned here. Both contain names that appear on the Verrazano
map; but an examination shows that both contain names not on that map, and each
contains at least one name not on the other. All these names are found on the map of
Maggiolo; and M. Desimoni concludes his paper with a table in four parallel columns,
in which a careful comparison is given of the nomenclature of four maps,&mdash;the Maggiolo
of 1527, the Verrazano of 1529, the Ulpius globe of 1542, and the Gastoldo of 1548.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>The earliest mention of the voyage of Gomez is found in Oviedo’s <i>Sumario</i>, which was
published at Toledo in 1526.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> It is there stated (folio xiv, <i>verso</i>) that Gomez returned in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
November from a voyage begun the year before (1524, which we now know is an error);
that he had found in the north “a greate parte of lande continuate from that which is
caued Baccaleos, discoursynge towarde the West to the xl. and xli. degree [et puesta
en quarenta grados y xli, et assi algo mas y algo menos], frō whense he brought certeyn
Indians,” etc.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>Peter Martyr’s <i>Decades</i> were published in a complete edition at Alcala in 1530,<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> and
his <i>Letters</i> appeared also that same year from the same press.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> He speaks thus of Gomez
in the Decades: “It is also decreed that one Stephanus Gomez, who also himselfe is a
skillful navigator, shal goe another way, whereby, betweene the Baccalaos and Florida,
long since our countries, he saith he will finde out a waye to Cataia: one onely shippe,
called a Caruell, is furnished for him, and he shall haue no other thing in charge then to
search out whether any passage to the great Chan, from out the diuers windings and vast
compassings of this our <i>Ocean</i>, were to be founde.”<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>And later he narrates the return of the expedition, its failure to find the strait (declaring
his own opinion that Gomez’ “imaginations were vaine and frivolous”), and tells the
story about the mistake of <i>cloves</i> and <i>slaves</i>.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> In a letter written in August, 1524, he
speaks also of the voyage of Gomez, but I find no mention of his return in that publication.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>Gomara devotes a short chapter to Gomez. He says that his purpose was to find a
northern passage, but that he failed; and so, loading his ship with slaves, returned home.
He also relates the <i>clove</i> anecdote.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>Herrera gives an account of Gomez and his voyage. He says: “Corriò por toda
aquella costa hasta la Florida, gran trecho de Tierra lo que hasta entonces, por otros
Navios Castellanos, no estaba navegado, aunque Sebastian Gaboto, Juan Verraçano, i otros
lo havian navegado.... Desde la Florida, atravesò à la Isla de Cuba, i fue à dar al
Puerto de Santiago, adonde se refrescò, i le regalò Andrès de Duero, por lo qual el Rei le
mostrò agradecimiento, bolviò à Castilla i aportò à la Coruña diez meses despues que
saliò de aquel Puerto,” etc.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> “He ran along that whole coast as far as Florida,&mdash;a
great stretch of land which, up to that time, had not been traversed by other Spanish
ships, although Sebastian Cabot, John Verrazano, and others had sailed along it....
From Florida he passed to the island of Cuba, and entered the port of Santiago, where
he refreshed, and Andrès de Duero regaled him, for which the King showed gratitude.
He returned to Castille, and landed at Corunna ten months after he had sailed from that
port,” etc.</p>

<p>Galvano, in his account of the voyage, appears to make Gomez sail along the American
coast from south to north; while Herrera, it will have been observed, reverses this direction.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
The testimony of Cespedes has already been considered.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Dr. Kohl, in his <i>Discovery
of Maine</i>, gives a good account of Gomez’ voyage, based on careful study of the
authorities.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>The mutinous conduct of Gomez in the fleet of Magellan is related by Pigafetta, who
accompanied that expedition, and kept a diary, from which he afterward made up an account
of the voyage. One of the copies of this, which existed only in manuscript, was given to
Louisa, mother of Francis I. of France, who employed Jacques Antoine Fabre to translate
it into French. He made in preference an abridgment of the account, and this was published
at Paris in 1525.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>For the opinion that a northern passage through America could be discovered somewhere
between Florida and the Baccalaos, Navarrete’s work may be consulted.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> He
gives among his documents the letter of the King commanding the attendance of Dornelos;<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
the agreement with Agramonte in 1511, and his commission as captain of the
expedition,<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> and the grant to De Ayllon.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> He has found also the appointment of Gomez
as pilot just before the sailing of his expedition, Feb. 10, 1525.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>The Agreement of Gomez with the Emperor for the voyage is printed in full in the
<i>Documentos ineditos</i>.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Hernando Cortes’ letter about the existence of the northern passage
may be consulted in an English translation in Mr. Folsom’s <i>Despatches of Cortes</i>.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>The discoveries of Gomez are laid down upon a map<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> of the world made, at the command
of the Emperor, in 1529 by Diego Ribero, a well-known cosmographer, who had
been sent to the Congress of Badajos as one of the Spanish experts.</p>

<p>On a large section of this coast extending from Cape Breton westward about three
hundred leagues to a point where the land bends to the south, is the legend: “<span class="smcap">Tierra de
Estevan Gomez</span> la qual descubrio por mandado de su mag<sup>t</sup> nel anno de 1525 ay en ella
muchos arboles y fructas de los de españa y muchos rodovallos y salmones y sollos: no
han allado oro.” (“<span class="smcap">The Country of Stephen Gomez</span>, which he discovered at the
command of his Majesty, in the year 1525. There are here many trees and fruits similar
to those in Spain, and many walruses and salmon, and fish of all sorts. Gold they have
not found.”)<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> This is supposed to have been drawn from the reports of Gomez, and to
contain his coast-lines and the names which he gave to places.</p>

<p>Oviedo wrote in 1537 a description of the American coast from a map made by Alonzo
de Chaves the year before. He frequently cites Gomez as his authority for the names
of places, etc. This part of Oviedo’s work remained in manuscript until its publication
by the Academy of Madrid in 1852. Dr. Kohl enters into an elaborate commentary of
this description by Oviedo, and the Chaves map, of which not even a copy has come
down to our times.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p class="p2">The books of André Thevet which contain the accounts of his visit to this country
are the <i>Singularitez de la France antarctique</i> and the <i>Cosmographie universelle</i>.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> Besides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
these works Thevet published an account of his journey to the East, <i>Cosmographie
du Levant</i>, at Lyons, in 1554, and a series of portraits and lives of great men, ancient
and modern, in two volumes, at Paris, in 1584. He left also several manuscripts, which
are now preserved in the National Library at Paris.</p>

<p>The <i>Singularitez</i> passed to a second edition,<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> and was translated into Italian by Giuseppe
Horologgi,<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> and into English<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> by M. Hacket. A reprint of the original edition
was published at Paris in 1878, with notes, and a biographical preface by M. Paul Gaffarel
of Dijon.</p>

<p>The <i>Cosmographie</i> was not reprinted, nor was it, so far as I know, translated into
any other language. In the <i>Magazine of American History</i> for February, 1882, however,
Dr. De Costa published a translation of the part of the book which relates to New
England.</p>

<p>It seems quite probable that Thevet never made the voyage along the American coast
of which he pretends to give an account. He gives nothing at all from Florida to what
he calls the River of Norumbega, and is generally very indefinite in all his statements.
He may easily have taken his stories from other travellers’ books, and it is known he used
Cartier and others; and indeed he is said to have been ill nearly all the time of his stay
in Brazil, and to have scarcely stirred out of the island where the fort was, waiting for the
ship to make ready for home.</p>

<p>Thevet’s reputation for veracity is poor, particularly among his contemporaries. Jean
de Léry, who was one of the party which went out to Villegagnon, in response to his
appeal for Protestant ministers in 1556, after Thevet’s return home, wrote an account
of the Brazil enterprise. This, first published at La Rochelle in 1578, passed through
several editions. The preface of the second edition is occupied with an exposure of the
“errors and impostures” of Thevet, and that of the fifth edition contains more matter
of the same kind. De Léry calls Thevet “impudent menteur,” and speaks of his books
as “vieux haillons et fripperies.” Again he says, “Il fait des contes prophanes, ridicules,
pueriles, et mensonges pour tous ses escrits.” Possibly some allowance may be made for
the <i>odium theologicum</i> of the writer, a Calvinist, disputing with a monk; and it may be
remembered that both had been disappointed in any hopes they had entertained of the
conversion of the Indians, through the treachery of Villegagnon.</p>

<p>Belleforest and Fumée have also written in harsh terms about Thevet. De Thou,
a historian of far more dignified and impartial character than these others, is nearly
as abusive. He says: “Il s’appliqua par une ridicule vanité à écrire des livres, qu’il vendait<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
à des misérables libraires: après avoir compilé des extraits de différents auteurs, il y
ajoutait tout ce qu’il trouvait dans les guides des chemins et autres livres semblables qui
sont entre les mains du peuple. Ignorant au-delà de ce qu’on peut imaginer, il mettait
dans ses livres l’incertain pour le certain, et le faux pour le vrai, avec une assurance
étonnante.”<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>Even Thevet’s latest editor, M. Gaffarel, is forced to begin his notice of the monk by
allowing that he was not “un de ces écrivans de premier ordre, qui, par la sûreté de leur
critique, le charme de leur style, ou l’intérét de leurs écrits commandent l’admiration à
leurs contemporains, et s’imposent à la postérité. Il passait, au contraire, même de son
temps, pour ne pas avoir un jugement très sur,” etc. M. Gaffarel claims for Thevet the
credit of introducing tobacco into France, and hopes that this may balance the imperfections
of his books.</p>

<p>Dr. Kohl gave some credence to Thevet’s narrative, but admits that he is “not
esteemed as a very reliable author.” Still, he translated the account of his visit to Penobscot
Bay, and inserted it entire in his <i>Discovery of Maine</i>.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> Dr. De Costa in 1870
criticised this view of Dr. Kohl.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p class="pbq"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Harrisse, in his recent <i>Discovery of North America</i> (p. 234), cites for the first time a long passage
about Gomez’s voyage from the Islario of Alonso de Santa Cruz, preserved in the Imperial Library at
Vienna, and finds it to be the source whence Cespedes (see <i>ante</i>, p. 24) drew his language; and in it he
finds somewhat uncertain proof that Gomez went as far north as the entrance of the Gulf of St. Lawrence,
and corrected some cartographical notions respecting those waters. A map showing Gomez’s discoveries is
attached to the <i>Islario</i>, and Harrisse gives this map in fac-simile.</p>

of minor coast localities in the earliest maps. The most trustworthy interpreters
recognize two important canons,&mdash;namely, that cartographical names during a long series
of years, and at an era of exploration forerunning settlements, are always suspicious and
often delusive, as Professor Bache has pointed out in the <i>Coast Survey Report</i> for 1855
(p. 10); and that direction is likely to be right, and distance easily wrong, as Humboldt
has explained. Nothing is more seductive than to let a spirit of dogmatism direct in the
interpretation of the early maps, and there is no field of research in which predisposition
to belief may lead one so wrongly. It was largely in the spirit of finding what they
sought, that the early map-makers fashioned their charts; and their interpretation depends
quite as much on geographical views current in those days as upon geographical facts
patent in these days.</p>

<p>The study of early American cartography may be said to have begun with Humboldt;
and in this restricted field no one has since rendered greater service than Dr. Kohl.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
Mr. Brevoort, not without justice, calls him “the most able comparative geographer of
our day.”<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> The labor which Dr. Kohl performed took expression not only in his publications,
but also in the collection of copies of early maps which he formed and annotated
for the United States Government twenty-five years ago. His later printed books,
using necessarily much of the same material, may be riper from longer experience; but
the Washington Collection, as he formed it, is still valuable, and deserves to be better
known. It belongs to the Department of State, and consists of not far from four hundred
maps, following printed and manuscript originals. They are carefully and handsomely
executed, but with little attempt at reproduction in fac-simile. By favor of the Secretary
of State, and through the interest of Theodore F. Dwight, Esq., the librarian of that
department, the collection has been intrusted to the Editor for use in the present work
and for the preparation of an annotated calendar of the maps which will be printed by
Harvard University.</p>

<p>Besides this collection in the State Department (which cost the Government nearly
$6,000), the Reports of the United States Coast-Survey<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> describe three other collections,
accompanied by descriptive texts, which he made for that office, and which he proposed
to call collectively “The Hydrographic Annals of the United States.” They repeat
many of the maps belonging to the State Department Collection. These supplemental
collections are,&mdash;</p>

<p>1. On the eastern coast of the United States, giving copies of 41 maps; the titles of
155 surveys of the coast between 1612 and 1851; a list of 291 works on the early explorations
of the coast; and an historical memoir on such voyages, from the Northmen
down.</p>

<p>2. On the coasts of the Gulf of Mexico falling within the United States, giving copies
of 48 maps from 1500 to 1846; the titles of 58 surveys (exclusive of those of the United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
States), between 1733 and 1851; a list of 221 books and manuscripts on the explorations

<p>3. On the west coast of the United States, giving a bibliography of 230 titles.</p>

<p>There is another historical memoir by Dr. Kohl, with other copies of the maps of the
west coast, in the Library of the American Antiquarian Society at Worcester, Mass.;

with the preparation of a history of the Search for
a Northwest Passage, from Cortes to Franklin, of which
only a fragment appeared in the Augsburg periodical,
<i>Ausland</i>. It was a theme which would naturally have
embraced the whole extent
of his knowledge of early
American discovery and
cartography.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>The best printed enumeration

<p>The map
of La Cosa
(1500) still
remains the
earliest of
these delineations,
and
a heliotype
of it is given
in another
volume.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> Harrisse has lately claimed the discovery in Italy of a Portuguese chart of 1502,
showing the coast from the Gulf of Mexico to about the region of the Hudson River,
which bears coast names in twenty-two places; but the full publication of the facts has
not yet been made;<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> and there is no present means of ascertaining what relation it bears
to a large manuscript map of the world, of Portuguese origin, preserved in the Archives
at Munich, of which a part is herewith sketched from Dr. Kohl’s copy, and to which he
gives the conjectural date of 1503.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>
<p>Dr. Kohl also reproduces it in part in his <i>Discovery of Maine</i>, p. 174, where he dates
it 1504. His two copies vary, in that the engraved one seems to make the east and west
coast-line from “Cabo de Conception” the determinate one, while his manuscript copy
gives the completed character to the other line. It is held to record the results of Cortereal’s
voyage, and shows in Greenland a more correct outline than any earlier chart.
The other coast seems to be Labrador and Newfoundland run into one. Peschel (<i>Geschichte
des Zeitalters der Entdeckungen</i>, p. 331) puts the date 1502 or 1503. The present
Cape Freels, on the Newfoundland coast, is thought to be a corruption of “Frey Luis,”&mdash;here
given to an island. (Cf. Kunstmann, <i>Die Entdeckung Amerikas</i>, pp. 69, 128.)
Harrisse (<i>Cabots</i>, p. 161) speaks of Kunstmann’s referring it to “Salvat de Pilestrina,”
and thinks that the author may be “Salvat[ore] de Palastrina” of Majorca. Lelewel
also gives in his <i>Géographie du Moyen-Âge</i> (plate 43) a map of importance in this connection,
which he dates 1501-1504, and which seems to be very like a combination of the
two Ptolemy maps of 1513. The Reinel Chart of 1505 has been referred to in the preceding
text.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Catalogue</i> of the Library of Parliament (Canada), 1858, p. 1614, gives what purports
to be a copy of a “Carte de l’embouchure du St. Laurent faite et dressée sur une
écorce de bois de Vouleau, envoyée du Canada par Jehan Denys, 1508.” Shea also mentions
it in his <i>Charlevoix</i>, i. 106, with a reference to Ramusio’s third volume. Mr. Ben:
Perley Poore, in his <i>Documents collected in France</i>, in the Massachusetts Archives, says
he searched for the original of this map at Honfleur without success. Harrisse, <i>Cabots</i>,
p. 250, says no such map is to be found in the Paris Archives; and a tracing being supplied
from Canada, he pronounces it “absolument apocryphe,” with a nomenclature of the
last century. Bancroft (<i>United States</i>, edition of 1883, i. 14) still, however, acknowledges
a map of Denys of this date.</p>

<p>The question of the duration of the belief in the Asiatic connection of North America
naturally falls into connection with the volume<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> of this work devoted to the Spanish discoveries.
We may refer briefly to a type of map represented by the Lenox globe<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
(1510-1512), the Stobnicza map<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> (1512), the so-called Da Vinci sketch<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> (1512-1515), the
Sylvanus map in the Ptolemy of 1511, the Ptolemy of 1513, the Schöner, or Frankfort,
globe of 1515,<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> the Schöner globe of 1520,<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> the Münster map of 1532,<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> and even so late a
representation as the Honter mappamundi of 1542, reproduced in 1552 and 1560. This type
represents a solitary island, or a strip of an unknown shore, sometimes joined with the
island, lying in the North Atlantic. The name given to this land is Baccalaos, or Corterealis,
or some equivalent form of those words, and their coasts represent the views which
the voyages of the Cabots and Cortereals had established. West and southwest of this the
ocean flowed uninterruptedly, till you came to the region of Florida and its northern extension.
The Portuguese seem to have been the first to surmise a continental connection to
this region, in a portolano which is variously dated from 1514 to 1520, and whose legends
have been quoted in the preceding text.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>The Portuguese claim of explorations in this region by Alvarez Fagundes in 1521, or
later, is open to question. If a map which is brought forward by C. A. de Bettencourt,
in his <i>Descobrimentos dos Portuguezes em terras do ultramar nos seculos xv e xvi</i>, published
at Lisbon in 1881-1882, represents the knowledge of a time anterior to Cartier, it
implies an acquaintance with this region more exact than we have other evidence of.
The annexed sketch of that map follows a colored fac-simile entitled, “Fac-simile de uma
das cartas do atlas de Lazaro Luiz,” which is given by Bettencourt. The atlas in which
it occurs was made in 1563, though the map is supposed to record the explorations of
João Alvarez Fagundes, under an authority from King
Manoel, which was given in 1521. Harrisse in his
<i>Cabots</i> (p. 277) indicates the very doubtful character
of this Portuguese claim.</p>

<p>The information concerning the Baccalaos region,
which was the basis of these Portuguese charts, seems
also to have been known, in part at least, a few years
later to Hieronymus Verrazano, and Ribero, though
the former contracted and the latter closed up the
passages by the north and south of Newfoundland.
The chart usually ascribed to Fernando Columbus<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
closely resembles that of Ribero. Of the Verrazano
map sufficient has been said in the preceding text;
but it may not be amiss to trace more fully the indications there given of its effect upon
subsequent cartography, so far as it established a prototype for a great western sea only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
separated at one point from the Atlantic by a slender isthmus. Mr. Brevoort (<i>Verrazano</i>,
p. 5) is of the opinion that the idea of the Western Sea originated with Oviedo’s <i>Sumario</i>
of 1526.</p>

<p class="pf200">There are several early copies of this map.
Harrisse describes the Weimar copy as having on
“Tiera del Labrador” the words, “Esta tierra
descubrieron los Ingleses no ay en ella cosa de
pronecho.” Thomassy says the Propagande
copy indicates the discovery of Labrador by the
English of Bristol. See Vol. III. pp. 16, 24,
and a note in chap. ix. of the present volume.
The Ribero contour of the eastern coast long
prevailed as a type. We find it in the Venice
map of 1534, of which there is a fac-simile in
Stevens’s <i>Notes</i>, and in the popular Bellero map
of 1554 (in use for many years), and, with little
modification, in so late a chart as Hood’s in
1592. It was held to for the coast between Florida
and Nova Scotia long after better knowledge
prevailed of the more northern regions.
It was evidently the model of the map published
by the Spanish Government in 1877 in
the <i>Cartas de Indias</i>.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Reference has already been made to the map
of Maggiollo, or Maiollo (1527), which Desimoni
has brought forward, and of which a fac-simile of
his sketch is reproduced on page 39. The sea will
be here observed with the designation, “Mare
Indicum.” Dr. De Costa showed a large photograph
of it at a meeting of the New York Historical
Society, May, 1883, pointing out that the
name “Francesca” gave Verrazano the credit of
first bestowing that name in some form upon
what was afterward known as New France.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>In 1870 there was published in the <i>Jahrbuch
des Vereins für Erdkunde in Dresden</i> (tabula
vii.) a fac-simile of a map of America from a
manuscript atlas preserved in Turin which gives conjecturally this western sea, closely
after the type shown below in a map of Baptista Agnese (1536); its date is put somewhere
between 1530 and 1540.</p>

<p>An Italian mappamundi of the middle of the sixteenth century is described by Peschel
in the <i>Jahresbericht des Vereins für Erdkunde in Leipzig</i>, 1871, where the map is given
in colored fac-simile. Peschel places it between 1534 and 1550; and it also bears a close
resemblance to the Agnese map, as does also a manuscript map of about 1536, preserved
in the Bodleian, of which Kohl, in his manuscript collection, has a copy. This Agnese
map is a part of a portolano in the Royal Library at Dresden; and similar ones by him
are said to be in the Royal Library at Munich, in the British Museum, and in the Bodleian,
dated a few months apart. Kohl, in his <i>Discovery of Maine</i> (pl. xiv.), sketches it
from the Dresden copy, and his sketch is followed in the accompanying cut. An account
of Agnese’s cartographical labors is given in another volume.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps the most popular map of America issued in the sixteenth century was
Münster’s of 1540, of which a fac-simile is annexed. Kohl, in his <i>Discovery of Maine</i>
(pl. xvª), erring, as has been pointed out by Murphy,<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> in giving a date (1530) ten years
too early to this map, and in ignorance of the Maiollo map, was led into the mistake of
considering it the earliest which has been found showing this western sea. The map was
frequently repeated, with changes of names, during that century, and is found in use in
books as late as 1572.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>In the same year (1540) a similarly conjectural western sea was given in a map of the
Portuguese Diego Homem, which is preserved in the British Museum. Kohl, in his
<i>Discovery of Maine</i> (pl. xv.), gives
this and other maps which support
in his judgment the belief in
the Verrazano Sea; but Murphy
(<i>Verrazzano</i>, p. 106) denies that
they contribute any evidence to
that end. Of the Ulpius globe,
mention has already been made.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>

<p>There are two maps which connect
this western sea, extending
southerly from the north, with the
idea that a belt of land surrounded
the earth, there being a connection
between Europe and Greenland,
and between Greenland and Labrador,
making America and Eastern
Asia identical. This theory
was represented in a map of 1544,&mdash;preserved
in the British Museum
and figured<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> by Kohl in his
<i>Discovery of Maine</i> (pl. xv.), who
assigns it to Ruscelli, the Italian geographer. Another support of the same theory is
found in the “Carta Marina” of the 1548 edition of Ptolemy (map no. 60).</p>

<p>Jacobo Gastaldo, or Gastaldi, was the cartographer of this edition, and Lelewel<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> calls
him “le coryphée des géographes de la peninsula italique.” Ruscelli, if he did not make
this map for Gastaldo, included it in his own edition of Ptolemy in 1561, the maps of
which have been pointed out by Thomassy as bearing “la plus grande analogie avec
celles de la galerie géographique de Pie IV.,” while the same authority<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> refers to a planisphere
of Ruscelli (1561) as “inédit, conservé au Musée de la Propagande.”<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>This union of North America and Asia was a favorite theory of the Italians long
after other nations had given it up.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> Furlani in 1560 held to it in a map, and Ruscelli,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
in another map of the 1561 edition of Ptolemy, leaves the question unsettled by a “littus
incognitum.”</p>

<p>One of the most conspicuous instances of a belief in this sea was the Lok map of
1582, which Hakluyt published, as has been already stated, in his <i>Divers Voyages</i> of that
year, which, being made “according to Verarzanus’s plot,” is reproduced here from the cut
already given in the preceding volume.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>With Lok we may consider that the western sea vanishes, unless there be thought a
curious relic of it in the map which John White, of the Roanoke Colony, made in 1585 of
the coast from the Chesapeake to Florida, which is preserved among the De Bry drawings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>

a copy of this map in the Kohl Collection; but the annexed sketch is taken from a fac-simile
engraving given by Dr. Edward Eggleston in <i>The Century Magazine</i>, November,
1882. It will be observed that at Port Royal there seems to be a passage to western
water of uncertain extent,<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> which was interpreted later as an inland lake.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="pc1 mid">JACQUES CARTIER AND HIS SUCCESSORS.</p>

<p class="pc1">BY THE REV. BENJAMIN F. DE COSTA, D.D.</p>

<p class="drop-cap06">JACQUES CARTIER, the Breton sailor, sometimes styled “the Corsair,”
was born at St. Malo, probably in 1491. He began to follow the
sea at an early age, and soon attained to prominence. In 1534 the discovery
of a western route to the Indies being a subject that attracted great attention,
Cartier undertook an expedition, for which preparations had been
begun during the previous year.</p>

<p>The Treaty of Cambrai having given peace to France, the privateersmen,
or “corsairs,” found that the best excuse for their occupation was gone;
and they were ready to engage in the work of exploration opened by
Francis I. in 1524, by sending out Verrazano. Accordingly the King appears
to have accepted the plan of Cartier submitted by Chabot, Admiral
of France, and the arrangements were perfected. Cartier’s commission for
the voyage has not yet been produced, though in March, 1533, he was
recognized by the Court of St. Malo as a person already authorized to
undertake a voyage to the New Land.</p>

<p>Cartier sailed from the ancient port of St. Malo, April 20, 1534. With
two ships of about sixty tons each, and a company, it would appear, of
sixty-two chosen men, he laid his course in the track of the old navigators,
with whom he must have been familiar. On May 10 he reached Cape
Bonavista, one of the nearest headlands of Newfoundland. Forced by
storms to seek refuge in the harbor of St. Catherine, about fifteen miles
south-southeast of Bonavista, he spent ten days in making some needed
repairs. With the return of favorable winds he resumed his voyage, and
coasted northward to the Island of Birds, which he found surrounded by
banks of broken ice and covered by an incredible number of fowl. With
these the French loaded their boats in half an hour. There, also, they saw
a large bear, “as white as any swan,” swimming thither “to eat of the said
birds.” On May 27 the ships reached the entrance of the Straits of Belle
Isle, but were obliged by the ice to enter the neighboring harbor of Carpunt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
51° N. From Carpunt, Cartier sailed to the Labrador coast, and,
June 10, reached a harbor which he called Port Brest. The next day
being the festival of St. Barnabas, divine service was said by the priest
serving as chaplain, after which several boats went along the coast to
explore, when they reached and named the harbors of St. Anthony, St.
Servans, and Jacques Cartier. At St. Servans the explorers set up a cross,
and near by, at a place called
St. John’s River, they found a
ship from Rochelle, which had
touched at Port Brest the previous
night.</p>

<p>The boats returned to the
ships on the 13th, the leader reporting
the appearance of Labrador
as forbidding, saying that
this must be the land that was
allotted to Cain. In this region
they found some savages who
were “wild and unruly,” and
who had come “from the mainland
out of warmer regions” in
bark canoes. They appear to
have been the Red Indians, or
Boeotics, of Newfoundland, who
were renowned as hunters, and
who excelled in the manufacture
of instruments carved in ivory
and bone. Professor Dawson
says that the Breton sailor here
stood in the presence of the
precise equivalent of the Flint Folk of his own country.</p>

<p>From Port Brest the expedition crossed the Strait and “sailed toward
the south, to view the lands that we had there seen, that appeared to us
like two great islands; but when we were in the middle of the Gulf we knew
it that it was <i>terra firma</i>, where there was a great double cape, one above
the other, and on this account we called it Cape Double.” This was Point
Rich, Newfoundland. Coasting the land, amid mists and storms, June 24 he
reached a cape, which in honor of the day he called Cape St. John,&mdash;now
known as Anguille. From Anguille Cartier sailed southwest into the Gulf,
reaching the Isles aux Margoulx, the present Bird Rocks, two of which
were “steep and upright as any wall,” where he was again impressed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the fowl, “innumerable as the flowers on a meadow.” Twenty-five miles
westward was another island, about six miles long and as many wide, being
fertile, and full of beautiful trees, meadows, and flowers. There were sea-monsters
on the shores, which had tusks like elephants. This he called
Brion Island, and the name still remains.</p>

<p>At this point both Ramusio’s narrative of the voyage and the <i>Discovrs
dv voyage</i> (1598) make Cartier say: “I think that there may be some
passage between Newfoundland and Brion Island;” but the text of the
<i>Relation originale</i><a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> reads, “between the New Land and the land of the
Bretons.” This has been accepted as teaching that Cartier at that time did
not know of the strait between Newfoundland and Cape Breton; and it is
argued that, as it afforded a shorter route from France to Canada, he would
have followed it, if he had known of its existence; yet in 1541, when he
certainly knew that strait, he took the route by Belle Isle, as twice before.
Again, on his second voyage, while passing through the southern strait
on his way to France, the narrative does not speak of any discovery.
The inference may be drawn that the passage quoted misrepresents Cartier.
Indeed, the portion of the narrative covering the movements around
Brion and Alezay Island is so confused that one with difficulty takes in
the situation. Dr. Kohl, in his <i>Discovery of Maine</i> (p. 326), represents
Brion’s Island as the present Prince Edward; though no map seems to
bear out the statement.</p>

<p>Next Cartier passed to an island “very high and pointed at one end,
which was named Alezay.” Its first cape was called St. Peter’s, in honor
of the day. This, as it would appear, is the present Prince Edward Island;<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>
but the account admits of large latitude of interpretation.</p>

<p>Cartier reached the mainland on the evening of the last day of June,
and named a headland Cape Orleans; next he found Miramichi Bay, or
the Bay of Boats, which he called St. Lunario. Here he had some hope
of finding a passage through the continent. On July 4 Cartier was surrounded
by a great fleet of canoes, and was obliged to fire his cannon
to drive the natives away. The next day, however, he met them on the
shore, and propitiated their chief with the present of a red hat. These
were the Micmacs, a coast tribe wandering from place to place, fishing
in the summer, and hunting in the interior during the winter. By July 8
he reached the bay which, on account of the heat, he called the Bay
Chaleur, known by the Indians as Mowebaktabāāk, or the Biggest Bay.
Here the Micmac country ended, and the natives were of another tribe,
visitors from Canada, who had descended the St. Lawrence to prosecute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the summer fisheries.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> They proved friendly, engaging in trade, and
showing a disposition which Cartier thought would incline them to receive
Christianity. The country was beautiful, but no passage was found extending
through the land; and accordingly he sailed northward, reaching a
place called St. Martin’s Creek, and saying that on this coast they have
“figs, nuts, pears, and other fruits.” Leaving St. Martin’s Creek, the coast
was followed to Cape Prato,&mdash;a name which appears like a reminiscence
of Albert de Prato, who was at Newfoundland in 1527.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> Forty natives
were seen in canoes; but they were poor, and almost in a nude condition.
They appeared to be catching mackerel in nets made of a kind of hemp.
Reaching Gaspé, July 24, a large cross was set up, with a shield attached,
bearing the fleur-de-lis and the motto: “Vive le Roi de France.” The
natives, however, protested, understanding that by setting up this <i>totem</i> the
strangers claimed a country to which they had no right. Afterward two
of the natives, Taignoagny and Domagaya, were entrapped and made
prisoners, while presents sent to the tribe seemingly afforded satisfaction.
The next day the expedition left the land, and, sailing out once more into
the Gulf, they saw the great Island of Anticosti, when, coasting its southern
shore, they named its eastern cape St. Loys. Thence Cartier steered
over to the coast of Labrador, searching for a passage to the west. On St.
Peter’s day he was in the strait between Anticosti and Labrador, which
forms one entrance to Canada. He called it St. Peter’s Channel; but he
did not know whither it led, and accordingly called a council. As the
result, the season being now far advanced, and the supplies running low,
it was resolved to return to France, and defer the examination of the strait
to some more favorable occasion. Cartier therefore left Anticosti, and
reached White Sand Island, August 9; on the 15th, after hearing Mass,
he passed through the Strait of Belle Isle into the ocean, and laid his
course for France. He had a prosperous passage, and arrived at St. Malo
early in September.</p>

<p>The main object of his voyage proved a failure, and a route to the Indies
was not discovered. He had approached close to the mouth of the St.
Lawrence, but was not aware of the fact. A correct knowledge of the
situation would have filled him with chagrin. As it was, he determined
to persevere; and upon reaching France he proceeded to prepare for another
voyage.</p>

<p class="p2">The representations made by the intrepid sailor had the desired effect,
and Admiral Chabot at once made known the condition of affairs to
Francis I., who signed a commission for Cartier, Oct. 30, 1534, authorizing
him to complete the exploration beyond Newfoundland. For this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
purpose the King gave Cartier three ships,&mdash;the “Great Hermina,” of
about one hundred and twenty tons, to be commanded by Cartier; the
“Little Hermina,” of sixty tons, under Macé Jalobert; and a small galley,
the “Emerilon,” in charge of Jacques Maingart. The men for his first
expedition had been obtained with difficulty, the sailors of St. Malo preferring
voyages with more certain and solid results than any to be gained
in Cartier’s romantic quest. Accordingly the King authorized him to
impress criminals. In a letter to the Most Christian King, Cartier advocated
the enterprise as one destined to open new fields for the activity of
the Church, which was now beginning to suffer from the effects of the
Protestant Reformation.</p>

<p>On Whit-Sunday, 1535, the members of the expedition&mdash;which does
not appear to have carried a priest, but included a number of prominent
gentlemen&mdash;went, by direction of Cartier, to confession, and afterward
received the benediction of the bishop as they knelt in the choir of the cathedral
church of St. Malo. Three days later Cartier sailed. Head-winds
and violent storms opposed the little fleet, rendering progress slow, and
entailing much hardship. June 25 the ships separated in a storm; but
on July 7 the “Great Hermina,” after much tossing, reached the Isle of
Birds, on the northern coast of Newfoundland,&mdash;one of the scenes of the
previous year’s visit. The port of White Sand, however, had been appointed
the rendezvous, and thither, July 26, Cartier went, being joined there by the
rest of the fleet. Next, crossing the strait to the Labrador coast, Cartier
sailed westward, reaching St. John’s River, August 10. He named it the
Bay of St. Lawrence,&mdash;a name afterward applied to the Gulf. August 12,
he consulted the two Indians captured the previous year, who diminished
his hope of finding a passage to the Indies, by showing that the channel
before him, named in honor of St. Peter, led to a river whose banks rapidly
contracted; while far within the interior the water was shallow, navigation
being obstructed by rapids. This, they likewise said, was the entrance
to the country of Canada. On August 18, sick at heart by the failure
to discover any passage through the continent, Cartier sailed back to the
northern shore. Three days later he named the great island lying in the
mouth of the Gulf, Assumption,<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> in honor of the festival; and finally, disbelieving
the Indians, and hoping that the channel between Labrador and
Anticosti opened to salt water, he ordered the course to be laid toward the
west, being led to this determination by seeing many whales. Soon, however,
the water began to freshen; yet hoping, as did Champlain long after,
that even the fresh water might afford a highway to the Indies, he entered
the river, viewing the banks on either side, and making his way upward.
Erelong he saw the wonderful Saguenay pouring through its gloomy gorge,
scooped out of solid rock by ancient glaciers, and was tempted to sail in
between the lofty walls which flung down their solemn shadows upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
deep and resistless stream. Here he met some timid natives in canoes,
engaged in hunting the seal. They fled, until they heard the voices of
his two savages, Taignoagny and Domagaya, when they returned, and gave
the French a hospitable reception. Without exploring the Saguenay,
Cartier returned to the main river, passing up to the Isle aux Coudres,
or Isle of Hazel-nuts, where he found the savages engaged in capturing a
marine monster called the “adhothoys,”&mdash;in form, says the narrative, as
shapely as a greyhound. This was the <i>Beluga catadon</i>, the well-known
white whale, whose bones are found in the post-pliocene clay of the St.
Lawrence. The manuscript of Allefonsce says: “In the Canadian Sea
there is one sort of fish very much like a whale, almost as large, white as
snow, and with a mouth like a horse.” Continuing his ascent, Cartier met
more of the natives, and at last encountered the lord of the country, the
well-known Donnacona, who dwelt at Stadaconna (Quebec). The chief
addressed the French commander in a set oration, delivered in the native
style with many gesticulations and contortions.</p>

<p>Finally Cartier reached a large island, which he called Bacchus Island,
with reference to the abundance of vines; though afterward it was given
the name it now bears, the Island of Orleans. Here he anchored his
fleet, and went on in boats to find a convenient harbor. This he discovered
near Stadaconna, at the mouth of the river now known as the St.
Charles, calling it the harbor of the Holy Cross. On September 14 the
ships were brought up. The French were received with great rejoicing
by all except Donnacona and the two natives, Taignoagny and Domagaya;
the latter had rejoined their old friends, and appeared “changed in
mind and purpose,” refusing to come to the ships. Donnacona had discovered
that Cartier wished to ascend the river to Hochelaga, and he
regarded this step as opposed to his personal interests. Finally, however,
a league of friendship was formed, when the two natives returned on board,
attended by no less than five hundred of the inhabitants of Stadaconna.
Still Donnacona persisted in his opposition to Cartier’s proposed exploration;
and finally dressed several members of his tribe in the garb of devils,
introducing them as delegates from the god Cudragny, supposed to dwell
at Hochelaga. The antics of these performers did not intimidate Cartier,
and accordingly, leaving a sufficient force to guard the ships, he started
with a pinnace and two boats containing fifty men. It was now the middle
of September, and the Canadian forests were putting on their robes of
autumnal glory. The scenery was at its best, and the French were greatly
impressed by the beauty of the country. On the 28th the river suddenly
expanded, and it was called the Lake of Angoulême, in recognition
of the birthplace of Francis I. In passing out of the lake, the strength of
the rapids rendered it necessary to leave the pinnace behind; but with the
two boats Cartier went on; and, October 2, after a journey of thirteen days,
he landed on the alluvial ground close by the current now called St.
Mary, about three miles from Hochelaga. He was received by throngs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
of the natives, who brought presents of corn-bread and fish, showing every
sign of friendship and joy. The next day Cartier went with five gentlemen
and twenty sailors to visit the people at their houses, and to view “a
certain mountain that is near the city.” They met a chief, who received
them with an address of welcome, and led them to the town, situated among
cultivated fields, and “joined to a great mountain that is tilled round about
and very fertile,” which Cartier called Mount Royal, now contracted into
Montreal. The town itself is described in the narrative of Cartier’s voyage
as circular and cunningly built of wood, having a single gate, being
fortified with a gallery extending around the top of the wall. This was
supplied with ammunition, consisting of “stones and pebbles for the defence
of it.” With the Hochelagans it was the Age of Stone. Their mode
of life is well described in the narrative which, in the Italian version of
Ramusio, is accompanied by a plan of the town. Cartier and his companions
were freely brought into the public square, where the women and
maidens suddenly assembled with children in their arms, kissing their visitors
heartily, and “weeping for joy,” while they requested Cartier to
“touch” the children. Next appeared Agouhanna, the palsied lord of
Hochelaga, a man of fifty years, borne upon the shoulders of nine or ten
men. The chief welcomed Cartier, and desired him to touch his shrunken
limbs, evidently believing him to be a superior being. Taking the wreath
of royalty from his own head, he placed it upon Cartier. Then the sick,
the blind, the impotent, and the aged were brought to be “touched;” for
it seemed to them that “God was descended and come down from heaven
to heal them.” Moved with compassion, Cartier recited a portion of the
Gospel of St. John, made the sign of the Cross, with prayer; afterward,
service-book in hand, he “read all the Passion of Christ, word by word,”
ending with a distribution of hatchets, knives, and trinkets, and a flourish
of trumpets. The latter made them all “very merry.” Next he ascended
the Mount, and viewed the distant prospect, being told of the extent of the
river, the character of distant tribes, and the resources of the country.
This done, he prepared for his return, and, amid the regrets of the natives,
started on the downward voyage.</p>

<p>In 1603, when Champlain reached the site of ancient Hochelaga, the
fortified city and its inhabitants had disappeared.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> With a narrative of
Cartier in hand, he doubtless sought the imposing town and its warlike and
superior inhabitants, as later, on the banks of the Penobscot, he inquired
for the ancient Norumbega, celebrated by so many navigators and historians.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
But Hochelaga, like its contemporary capital on the great river of
Maine, had disappeared, and the Hochelagans were extinct.</p>

<p>On October 11 Cartier reached the Harbor of Holy Cross, where, during
his absence, the people had constructed a fort and had mounted artillery.
Donnacona and the two natives reappeared, and Cartier visited the
chief at Stadaconna, the people coming out in due form to receive him.
He found the houses comfortable after their fashion, and well provided
with food for the approaching winter. The scalps of five human heads
were stretched upon boughs, and these, Cartier was told, were taken from
their enemies, with whom they were in constant warfare, as it would appear
from their defences and from other signs. The inhabitants of Stadaconna
were nevertheless inclined to religion, and earnestly desired to be baptized;
when Cartier, who appears to have been a good lay preacher, explained its
importance,&mdash;though he could not accede to their request, as he had with
him neither priest nor chrism. The next year he promised to provide
both.</p>

<p>It would appear that at the outset Cartier had decided to winter in the
country and upon his return from Hochelaga preparations were made. His
experience, however, was somewhat sad, and nothing was gained by the
decision to remain, except some traffic.</p>

<p>In the month of December a pestilence broke out among the natives,
of whom finally the French came to see but little, as the Indians were
charged not to come near the fort. Soon afterward the same disease
attacked the French, proving to be a form of the scurvy, which at one
time reduced all but ten of Cartier’s company to a frightful condition,
while eventually no less than twenty-five died. In their distress an image
of Christ was set up on the shore. They marched thither, and prostrated
themselves upon the deep snow, chanting litanies and penitential psalms,
while Cartier himself vowed a pilgrimage to Our Lady of Rocquemado.
Nevertheless on that day Philip Rougemont died. Cartier, being determined
to leave nothing undone, ordered a <i>post-mortem</i> examination of the
remains of this young man from Amboise. This afforded no facts throwing
light upon the disease, which continued its ravages with still greater virulence,
until the French learned from the natives that they might be cured
by a decoction made from a tree called <i>ameda</i>. The effect of this medicine
proved so remarkable, that if “all the doctors of Montpelier and
Louvain had been there with all the drugs of Alexandria, they would not
have done so much in a year as that tree did in six days.” Winter finally
wore away, and in May, on Holy-Rood Day, Cartier set up a fair cross
and the arms of France, with the legend, “Franciscus Primus, Dei gratia
Francorum Rex regnat,” concluding the act by entrapping the King Donnacona,
and carrying him a prisoner on board his ship. The natives vainly
offered a ransom, but were pacified on being told that Cartier would return
the next year and bring back their king. Destroying one of his vessels,
the “Little Hermina,” on May 6, Cartier bade the people adieu, and sailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
down to a little port near the Isle of Orleans, going thence to the Island
of Hazel-Nuts, where he remained until the 16th, on account of the swiftness
of the stream. He was followed by the amazed savages, who were
still unwilling to part with their king. Receiving, however, assurances
from Donnacona himself that he would return in a year, they affected a
degree of satisfaction, thanked Cartier, gave him bundles of beaver-skins,
a chain of <i>esurguy</i>,<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> or wampum, and a red copper knife from the Saguenay,
while they obtained some hatchets in return. He then set sail;<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>
but bad weather forced him to return. He took his final departure May
21, and soon reached Gaspé, next passing Cape Prato, “the beginning
of the Port of Chaleur.” On Ascension Day he was at Brion Island. He
sailed thence towards the main, but was beaten back by head-winds. He
finally reached the southern coast of Newfoundland, giving names to the
places he visited. At St. Peter’s Island he met “many ships from France
and Britain.” On June 16 he left Cape Race, the southern point of Newfoundland,
having on this voyage nearly circumnavigated the coast of the
island, and thus passed to sea, making a prosperous voyage, and reached
St. Malo July 6, 1536. Though, according to the narrative, Cartier gave
the name of St. Paul to the north coast of Cape Breton, this appellation was
on the map of Maijolla, 1527, and that of Viegas, drawn in the year 1533.
Manifestly the narrative does Cartier some injustice.</p>

<p class="p2">Several years passed before anything more was done officially respecting
the exploration of the New Lands. Champlain assumes that Cartier made
bad representations of the country, and discouraged effort. This view has
been repeated without much examination. It is clear that all were disappointed
by finding no mines of precious metals, as well as by the failure
to discover a passage to the Indies; yet for all this Cartier has been maligned.
This appears to be so from the statement found in the narrative of
the third voyage, which opens in a cheerful strain, the writer saying that
“King Francis I. having heard the report of Captain Jacques Cartier, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
pilot-general, in his two former voyages of discovery, as well by writing as
by word of mouth, respecting that which he had found and seen in the
western parts discovered by him in the ports of Canada and
Hochelaga; and having seen and talked with the people which
the said Cartier had brought from those countries,
of whom one was King of Canada,” resolved to
“send Cartier, his pilot, thither again.” With the
navigator he concluded to associate Jean François
de la Roche, Lord of Roberval, invested
with a commission as Lieutenant and Governor
of Canada and Hochelaga. Roberval was a gentleman of Picardy, highly
esteemed in his province; and, according to Charlevoix, he was sometimes
styled by Francis I. the “petty King of Vimeu.” Roberval was commissioned
by Francis I. at Fontainebleau, Jan. 15, 1540, and on February 6
took the oath in the presence of Cardinal de Tournon. His subordinate,
Cartier, was not appointed until October 17 following, his papers being
signed by Henry the Dauphin on the 20th.</p>

<p>The apparent object of this voyage is stated where the narrative recites
that it was undertaken “that they might discover more than was done
before in some voyages, and attain, if possible, to a knowledge of the country
of the Saguenay, whereof the people brought by Cartier, as is declared,
mentioned to the King that there were great riches and very good lands.”
The first and second voyages of Cartier may not have attracted the attention
of the Spaniards; but when the expedition of 1541 was in preparation
Spain sought to interfere, as in the case of Verrazano in 1523.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> Francis
anticipated this, Alexander VI. having coolly given all America to Spain,
as she eagerly claimed; and the explanation was that the fleet was simply
going to the poor region of Baccalaos. The Spanish ambassador, knowing
well that his master was too poor to support his pretensions by force
of arms, finally came to the conclusion that the French could do no harm,
while others prophesied a failure.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>To carry out the voyage, a sum of money was placed at the disposal
of Roberval, who agreed with Cartier to build and equip five<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> vessels.
Soon the shipyards of St. Malo resounded with the din of labor, and the
Breton carpenters promptly fulfilled their task. Roberval, however, had
not in the mean time completed his preparations, and yet, having express
orders from the King not to delay, Cartier, with the approval of Roberval,
set sail with three or more ships, May 23, 1541. He encountered a succession
of storms for three months, having less than thirty hours of fair wind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
in all that time. One ship, under the Viscount of Beaupré, kept company
with Cartier, but the rest were scattered. The fleet assembled at Carpunt,
in Newfoundland, waiting in vain for Roberval. Cartier accordingly went
on, and reached the Harbor of Holy Cross, August 23. The savages hailed
him with joy, and inquired for their chief, Donnacona, and the other
captives. They were informed that Donnacona had died in France, where
he had received the faith and been baptized, while the rest had married,
and stayed there as great lords, whereas in fact all except a little girl had
died.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> Agona, who had ruled during the interregnum, was not at all dissatisfied,
as it left him invested with kingship; yet, as a compliment, he
took the crown of tanned leather and <i>esurguy</i> from his own head, and
placed it upon Cartier’s, whose wrists he also adorned with his bracelets,
showing signs of joy. This, however, was mere dissimulation. Next, Cartier
took his fleet to a harbor four leagues nearer Quebec, where he built a
fort called Charlesbourg Royal. On the 2d of September Macé Jalobert, his
brother-in-law, and Etienne Noel, his nephew, were sent back to France with
two of his ships, to report the non-arrival of Roberval. Leaving Beaupré
in command at Charlesbourg Royal, Cartier ascended the St. Lawrence,
visiting on the way a lord of Hochelay. In his previous voyage this
chief had proved sincere, informing him of the meditated treachery of
Taignoagny and Domagaya. He now bestowed upon him “a cloak
of Paris red,” with yellow facings and tin buttons and bells. Going on,
Cartier passed Hochelaga, and attempted to ascend the rapids, two of
which he actually stemmed. Arriving at Hochelaga, he found that the
chief had gone to Quebec to plot against him with Agona. Returning
to Charlesbourg, he passed the winter, seeing little of the natives. In
the spring, having gathered a quantity of quartz crystals, which he fancied
were diamonds, and some thin scales of metal supposed to be gold, he
sailed for France. In the Harbor of St. John, Newfoundland, Hakluyt
says, he met Roberval, then on his way to Canada. The “gold” was tried
in a furnace, and “found to be good.” Cartier reported the country rich
and fruitful; but when ordered by Roberval to return, he pleaded his
inability to stand against the savages with so small a number of men;
while in Hakluyt we read that “hee and his company, moued as it seemeth
with ambition, because they would haue all the glory of the discouerie
of those partes themselues, stole privately away the next night from us,
and, without taking their leaues, departed home for Bretainye.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>This, however, appears to be wrong; as at the time he is represented
as meeting Roberval at Newfoundland his chief must have been in Canada,
he having left France Aug. 22, 1541. Hakluyt’s informant was confused,
and the ships met by Roberval at Newfoundland may have been those
two despatched by Cartier to France under Jallobert and Noel during the
previous autumn, or else Cartier on his way home in June met Sainterre.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>Jean François de la Roche, Lord of Roberval, in connection with
Cartier, was commissioned for his expedition by a royal patent, Jan. 15,
1540. His fleet consisted of three tall ships and a company of two hundred
persons, including women and gentlemen of quality. Sainterre
was his lieutenant, and Jean Allefonsce his pilot-general. According to
Hakluyt, he sailed from Rochelle, April 14, 1542,&mdash;more than a year
after the time originally appointed,&mdash;reaching St. John’s, Newfoundland,
June 8, where he found seventeen fishing-vessels. While delayed here,
Hakluyt says, Cartier appeared in the harbor, and afterward left secretly,
as already stated, to return to France. As a matter of fact, however,
Roberval sailed from Honfleur, Aug. 22, 1541. We must not be misled,
therefore, where Hakluyt says that on the last day of June, 1542, having
composed a quarrel between the French and Portuguese fishermen, he
sailed on his voyage through the Gulf. This he must have done during
the preceding autumn. Yet, whenever he may have ascended the
St. Lawrence, Roberval reached the Isle of Orleans in safety, and found
a good harbor. Hakluyt says that at the end of July he landed his
stores, and began to fortify above Quebec at France Royal;<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> if it was in
July, it must have been July, 1542. Roberval, possibly, reached his winter-quarters
in 1541, when it was too late to fortify. Hakluyt, having been
misinformed on the expedition, supposed that Cartier and Roberval were
not together in Canada; but there is much uncertainty in any conclusion.</p>

<p>A strong, elevated, and beautiful situation was selected by Roberval, with
“two courtes of buildings, a great toure, and another of fourtie or fiftie
foote long; wherein there were diuers chambers, an hall, a kitchine, houses
of office, sellers high and lowe, and neere vnto were an oven and milles, and
a stoue to warme men in, and a well before the house.”</p>

<p>Hakluyt says that, September 14, Roberval sent back to France two
ships under Sainterre and Guincourt, bearing tidings to the King, and requesting
information respecting the value of Cartier’s “diamonds.” It
would appear, however, that these vessels were sent late in 1541, for the
reason that Jan. 26, 1542, Francis I. ordered Sainterre to go to the rescue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
of Roberval,&mdash;the language of the order indicating that he had already
been out to Canada. On preparing for the winter, Roberval, according to
Hakluyt, found his provisions scanty. Still, having fish and porpoises, he
passed the season, though the bad food bred disease, and not less than fifty
of the company died. The people were vicious and insubordinate; but the
“Little King” was equal to the occasion, dealing out even and concise justice,
laying John of Nantes in irons, whipping both men and women soundly,
and hanging Michael Gaillon,&mdash;“by which means they lived in quiet.”</p>

<p>The account of Hakluyt ends abruptly; yet he states that June 5, 1543,
Roberval went on an expedition to explore above Quebec, appointing
July 1 as the time of his return. If he did not appear then, the thirty persons
left behind were authorized to sail for France, while he would remain
in the country. What followed is invested with more or less uncertainty,
as we have no authority except Hakluyt, who says that in an expedition
up the river eight men were drowned, and one “boate” lost; while, June
19, word came from Roberval to stay the departure from France Roy until
July 22. To this statement Hakluyt adds, “the rest of the voyage is wanting.”
His account of both Roberval and Cartier’s operations are hardly
to be relied upon, since he was so badly informed. The circumstances
under which Roberval returned to France may perhaps never be known;
yet it is certain that Cartier went out to bring him home some time in the
year 1543. He did not leave on this voyage until after March 25, as he
was present at a baptism in St. Malo on that day, while he had returned
before February 17, 1544, on which date, as Longrais has discovered recently
among the documents, he was a witness in court at St. Malo. The
subject will be referred to again.</p>

<p class="p2">At this point it will be proper to give some account of the personal
operations of Jehan, or Jean, Allefonsce, the pilot of Roberval. He was
born at Saintonge, a village of Cognac, and was mortally wounded in a
naval combat which took place near the Harbor of Rochelle, having followed
the sea during a period of forty-one years. He appears to have
been engaged in two special explorations,&mdash;one carrying him to the north,
and the other to the vicinity of Massachusetts Bay.</p>

<p>Of the first expedition&mdash;that connected with the Saguenay or vicinity&mdash;we
have no account in the narrative which covers the voyage of Roberval.
Father Le Clercq, however, says: “The Sire Roberval writes that he undertook
some considerable voyages to the Saguenay and several other rivers.
It was he who sent Allefonsce, a very expert pilot of Saintonge, to Labrador
to find a passage to the Indies, as was hoped. But not being able to carry
out his designs, on account of the heights of ice that stopped his passage,
he was obliged to return to M. de Roberval with only this advantage, of
having discovered the passage which is between the Isle of Newfoundland
and the Great Land of the north by the fifty-second degree.”<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> Le Clercq<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
gives no authority for his statement, and one writer<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> discredits it, for the
reason that Allefonsce is made to “discover” the passage between Newfoundland
and Labrador. It is probable, however, that Le Clercq, or his
authority, meant no more by the term “discover” than to explore, as
the Strait of Belle Isle was at that period as well known as Cape Breton.
Allefonsce’s narrative and maps do not show that he explored the
Saguenay.</p>

<p>It can hardly be questioned that a voyage was made by Allefonsce along
the Atlantic coast. The precise date, however, cannot be fixed. His <i>Cosmographie</i>
proves that he had a personal knowledge of the country. The
voyage might have been made on some one of the ships which returned to
France while Roberval was in the country. Failing to discover any passage
to the Indies, Allefonsce may have run down the Atlantic coast, hoping to
find some hitherto neglected opening. At all events, when he visited the
coast he found a great bay in latitude forty-two, apparently Massachusetts
Bay. The original notice is found in his <i>Cosmographie</i>, now preserved in
the Bibliothèque nationale, Paris. It runs: “These lands reach to Tartary;
and I think that it is the end of Asia,<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> according to the roundness of the
world. And for this purpose it would be well to have a small vessel of
seventy tons, in order to discover the coast of Florida; for I have been at
a bay as far as forty-two degrees, between Norumbega and Florida, but I
have not seen the end, and do not know whether it extends any farther.”<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>
The belief in a western passage was after all very hard to give up, and
Champlain, in the next century, was consumed by the idea.</p>

<p class="p2">In closing this part of the subject, we have to inquire concerning the
outcome of the costly and laborious efforts of Cartier and Roberval under
Francis I. Some popular writers would lead us to suppose that subsequent
to the return of the expedition of 1543 the region of the Gulf and River of
St. Lawrence were deserted.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> Gosselin, in his <i>Documents relating to the
Marine of Normandy</i>, shows that the explorations of Cartier were attended
and followed by active operations conducted by private individuals. During
the first years of the sixteenth century, inspired by the example of
Bethencourt, in connection with the Canaries, the seaport towns of France
showed great enterprise. After the return of Verrazano, however, much
discouragement was felt, nor did the voyages of 1534-1536 stimulate so
large a degree of activity as might have been expected; but in 1540 all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the maritime towns were alive to the importance of the New Lands.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> In
that year, as we have already seen, such was the scarcity of sailors, owing
to the prosecution of remunerative fisheries, that the authorities of St. Malo
were obliged to order that no vessel should leave port until Cartier had
secured a crew. In 1541 the prospect of the settlement of Canada under
the French gave such a stimulus to merchants, that in the months of
January and February, 1541, 1542, no less than sixty ships went “to fish
for cod in the New Lands.”<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> Gosselin, who had examined a great number
of the ancient records, says: “In 1543, 1544, and 1545, this ardor
was sustained; and during the months of January and February, from
Havre and Rouen, and from Dieppe and Honfleur, about two ships left
every day.”<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>In 1545 no ship of the King went to Canada, and a sense of insecurity
prevailed, as the Spaniards and Portuguese at Newfoundland were ever
ready to make trouble; but in 1560 no less than thirty ships left the little
ports of Jumièges, Vatteville, and La Bouille, “to make the voyage to the
New Lands;”<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> while at this period the tonnage of the vessels engaged
rose from seventy to one hundred and fifty tons. In 1564 the French
Government was engaged in New France, and April 18 of that year the
King’s Receiver-General, Guillaume Le Beau, bought of Robert Gouel, as
attested by the notaries of Rouen, a variety of material, “to be carried into
New France, whither the King would presently send on his service.”<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>On the seventh of the same month Le Beau paid four hundred livres for
arms and accoutrements necessary for the “French infantry,” which “it
pleased the King to send presently into his New France for its defence.”<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>
This shows that the idea of colonization was not abandoned, and that the
King asserted his rights there. He was no doubt accustomed to send
cruisers to Canada to protect French interests, as the English at an early
period sent ships of war to the coast of Iceland to protect fishermen and
traders.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>In 1583 Stephen Bellinger, a friend of Hakluyt, being in the service
of Cardinal Bourbon, of Rouen, visited Cape Breton and the coasts to
the south.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> In 1577 and 1578 commissions were issued by Henry III. to
the Marquis de la Roche for a colony;<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> and Hakluyt says that in 1584 the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Marquis was cast away in an attempt to carry out his scheme.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> In 1587
the grandnephew of Cartier was in Canada, evidently engaged in regular
trade.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> Beyond question communication was maintained with Canada until
official colonization was again taken up in 1597.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> The efforts of Francis I.
in sending out Verrazano, Cartier, and Roberval were by no means thrown
away, and we must take for what it is worth the statement of Alexander in
his <i>Encouragement to Colonies</i>, where (p. 36) he says that the French in
America effected more “by making a needless ostentation, that the World
should know they had beene there, then that they did continue still to
inhabit there.”</p>

<h3><a name="c62" id="c62"></a>CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap16">LITTLE is known of the personal history of Jacques Cartier, though Cunat discovered
several points relating to his ancestry. It appears that one Jehan Cartier married
Guillemette Baudoin; and that of their six children, Jamet, or Jacques, was the oldest,
having been born Dec. 4, 1458. Marrying in turn Jeffeline Jansart, he had by her a
son, Dec. 31, 1494. This son, up to a recent day, was held to be the great navigator; but
Longrais has rendered it almost certain that he was not.</p>

<p>Like Verrazano, Allefonsce, and others, he appears to have done something as a privateer;
and the Spanish ambassador in France, reporting the expedition of Cartier and
Roberval, Dec. 17, 1541, spoke of “el corsario Jacques Cartier.”<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>At an early age Cartier was wedded to Catharine des Granches, daughter of Jacques
des Granches, the constable of St. Malo, this being considered a brilliant marriage. After
retiring from the sea, he lived in the winter at his house in St. Malo, adjoining the
Hospital of St. Thomas, and in the summer at his manor on the outskirts of the town
at Limoilou.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> The name of Des Granches appears in connection with the mountains
on the shores of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Cartier, so far as known, had no children.
At least Cunat’s researches, supported by the local tradition, show that Manat had no
authority now recognized for saying that in 1665 he had a lineal descendant in one
Harvée Cartier.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>Following Verrazano, we have the earliest notice of French visitations to the coast in
the statement of Herrera,<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> that in 1526 the Breton, Nicolas Don, pursued the fisheries
at Baccalaos. In 1527 Rut, as reported in Purchas,<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> says that eleven sail of Normans and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
one of Bretons were at St. John, Newfoundland.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> According to Lescarbot,<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> who gives
no authority, the Baron de Léry landed cattle on the Isle of Sable in 1528.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>Next in the order of French voyages we reach those of Cartier. The narrative of his
first voyage appeared originally in the <i>Raccolta</i>, etc., of Ramusio, printed at Venice in
1556.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> It was translated from the Italian into English by John Florio, and appeared
under the title, <i>A Short and Briefe Narration of the Two Navigations and Discoveries to
the Northweast Partes called Newe Fraunce</i>, London, 1580.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> This was adopted by Hakluyt,
and printed in his <i>Navigations</i>, 1600.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> Another account of this voyage appeared in
French, printed at Rouen, 1598, having been written originally in a <i>langue étrangere</i>. It
has been supposed very generally that the “strange language” was Italian, and that it was
a translation from Ramusio;<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> but this opinion is questioned.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> Another narrative of the
voyage has been found and published as an original account by Cartier.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> In the Preface
to the volume the Editor sets forth his reasons for this opinion. It is noticeable that
each of these three versions is characterized by an obscurity to which attention has been
called.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> Nearly all the facts of the first voyage, handled, like the rest of his voyages, by
so many writers, come from one of these three versions.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> The patent for the voyage, as in
the case of the voyage of Verrazano, is not known.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>The narrative of the second voyage was published at Paris in 1545.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> Ramusio<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> accompanies
the narrative of the first voyage with an account of the second, also in Italian.
Three manuscript versions of the narrative are preserved in the Bibliotheque Nationale,
and are described by Harrisse in his <i>Notes</i>.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> Hakluyt<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> appears to follow Ramusio.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>
The patents for the second voyage will be found in Lescarbot (<i>Nouvelle France</i>), who
used in his account of Cartier what is known as the Roffet text, though he abridges
and alters somewhat; and he in turn was followed by Charlevoix.</p>

<p>For the third voyage of Cartier, unfortunately, we have only a few facts in addition
to the fragment preserved by Hakluyt,<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> which ends with events at the close of September,
1541. An account of the voyage of Roberval is added thereto.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> The commission
of Cartier is found in Lescarbot’s <i>Nouvelle France</i>.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> All that was formerly known was
taken from Hakluyt; but facts that somewhat recently have come to light, though few,
are nevertheless important, proving that Hakluyt’s information respecting Roberval was
poor, like that which he gives of the voyage of Rut (1527). Rut’s voyage was tolerably
well understood by Purchas, who wrote after Hakluyt. Bancroft, in his <i>History of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the United States</i>,<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> writes on the subject of Cartier as he wrote forty-nine years earlier;<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>
while nearly all historical writers, whether famous or obscure, have written in a similar way.
They have been misled by Hakluyt. The statement that Cartier, on his way home in
June, 1542, encountered Roberval at Newfoundland, and deserted him in the night, is not
in keeping with his character, and is rendered improbable by the fact that in the previous
autumn Roberval sailed for Canada. All things, so far as known, indicate that a good
understanding existed between the two commanders, and that circumstances alone prevented
the accomplishment of larger results. Certainly, if Cartier had failed in his duty,
history would have given some record of the fact. Francis I. would not have employed
any halting, half-hearted man who was trying to discourage exploration. Let us here,
then, endeavor to epitomize the operations of Roberval and Cartier:&mdash;</p>

<p>Jan. 15, 1540, Roberval was appointed lieutenant-general and commander.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> February
6 he took the oath,<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> followed the next day by letters-patent confirming those of January 15.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
February 27 Roberval appointed Paul d’Angilhou, known as Sainterre, his lieutenant.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>
March 9 the Parliament of Rouen authorized Roberval to take certain classes of criminals

<p>This, so far as our present knowledge goes, formed the end of Cartier’s seafaring.
Thereafter, without having derived any material financial benefit from his great undertakings,
Cartier, as the Seigneur of Limoilou, dwelt at his plain manor-house on the outskirts
of St. Malo, where he died, greatly honored and respected, about the year 1555.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Charlevoix affirms that Roberval made another attempt to colonize Canada in 1549;<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>

<p>There is no evidence to prove that Cartier gave any name to the country which he
explored. The statement found at the end of Hakluyt’s version of the second voyage,<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
to the effect that the Newfoundlands “were by him named New France,” originated with
the translator. It is not given in connection with the text of Ramusio, nor in the French
edition of 1545, though that <i>Relation</i> (p. 46) employs the language, “Appellée par nous
la nouvelle France.” In the same folio we find the writer stating of Cape St. Paul,
“Nous nommasmes le cap de Sainct Paul,” though the name had been given at an early
period, appearing upon the Maijolla map of 1527.</p>

<p>“Canada” was the name which Cartier found attached to the land,<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> and there is no
evidence that he attempted to displace it. It is indeed said, in Murphy’s <i>Voyage of Verrazzano</i>,<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>
that the name “Francisca” was due to Cartier. He says, “This name Francisca,
or the <i>French Land</i>,”&mdash;found on a map in the Ptolemy printed at Basle in 1540,&mdash;was
“due to the French under Jacques Cartier, and which could properly belong to no
other exploration of the French.” This statement was made in rebuttal of that by Brevoort
in his <i>Verrazano the Navigator</i> (p. 141), where he says that “the first published
map containing traces of Verrazano’s exploration is in the Ptolemy of Basle, 1530, which
appeared four years before the French renewed their attempts at American exploration.
It shows the western sea without a name, and the land north of it called Francisca.” As
it appears, there is no edition of Ptolemy bearing date of 1530; yet the student is sufficiently
correct in referring the name “Francisca” to the voyage of Verrazano, especially
as the Maijollo map, 1527, applies “Francesca” to North America, this map having been
made only three years after the voyage of Verrazano, performed in 1524. Evidently,
however, Verrazano was not more anxious than Cartier about any name, since on the
map of his brother Hieronymus da Verrazano (1529), this region is called “Nova Gallia,
sive Yucatania.”</p>

<p>Nor did Roberval attempt to name the country, while the commission given him by
the King does not associate the name of Francis or any new name therewith. The misunderstanding
on this point is now cleared up.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>Cartier did not give any name to the Gulf, simply applying the name of St. Lawrence
to what may have been the St. John’s River, on the Labrador coast, where he chanced
to be on the festival of that saint in 1535. Gomara thus writes in 1555: “A great river,
named San Lorenço, which some consider an arm of the sea. It has been navigated two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
hundred leagues up, on which account many call it the Straits of the Three Brothers (<i>los
tres hermanos</i>). Here the water forms a square gulf, which extends from San Lorenço
to the point of Baccallaos, more than two hundred leagues.”<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Little is known at present of the personal history of Jean Allefonsce. D’Avezac, in
the <i>Bulletin de géographie</i>,<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> attempted to give an account of the man and his work;
and Margry, in his <i>Navigations Françaises</i>, added substantial information. At one time
he was claimed by the Portuguese as of their nation, because he voyaged to Brazil; but
his French origin is now abundantly proved out of the book published by Jean de Marnef
in 1559, entitled <i>Les voyages avantureux du Capitaine du Alfonce Saintongeois</i>. It is
a small volume in quarto, numbering sixty-eight leaves, the verso of the last one bearing
the epilogue: “End of the present book, composed and ordered [?] by Jan Alphonce,
an experienced pilot in things narrated in this book, a native of the country of Xaintonge,
near the city of Cognac. Done at the request of Vincent Aymard, merchant of the country
of Piedmont, Maugis Vumenot, merchant of Honfleur, writing for him.”</p>

<p>Allefonsce appears to have been of a brave, adventurous, and somewhat haughty spirit.
We are even told that he was once imprisoned at Poitiers by royal orders.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> He was considered
a man of ability, and was trusted on account of his great skill. In Hakluyt<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> it is
said, “There is a pardon to be seene for the pardoning of <i>Monsieur de saine terre</i>, Lieutenant
of the sayd <i>Monsieur de Roberval</i>, giuen in Canada in presence of the sayde <i>Iohn
Alphonse</i>.”</p>

<p>The sailor of Saintonge met his death in a naval engagement, though most writers
appear to have overlooked the fact. It is indicated in a sonnet written by his eulogist,
Melin Saint-Gelais, and prefixed to the first edition of the <i>Voyages avantureux</i>, 1559. The
allusion was pointed out by Harrisse in his <i>Notes sur la Nouvelle France</i>, Paris, 1872
(p. 8), indicating that this event must have taken place before March 7, 1557,&mdash;the date
of the imprimatur of the edition of 1559.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> Mr. Brevoort, in his <i>Verrazano the Navigator</i>,
quoting Barcia’s Ensayo, etc., Madrid, 1723, fol. 58, shows that he fought Menendez, the
Spaniard, near the reef of Rochelle, and was mortally wounded.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p>There is no true connection between the manuscript of Allefonsce, now preserved in
the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris, catalogued under Secalart, and the volume of <i>Voyages
avantureux</i> which bears his name. This latter work we owe, in some not understood
sense, to the enterprise of a publisher who brought it out after the old mariner’s death.
The erroneous character of certain of its statements excited the criticism of Lescarbot;<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>
yet several descriptions of our coast are recognizable, and very interesting. In this printed
book the matter relating to the North Atlantic coast occupies only about three pages,&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
chief points for which were taken, it appears, from the manuscript of Allefonsce,
though several particulars not found in his manuscript are given.</p>

<p>The manuscript itself must be judged leniently, as Secalart was concerned in the
composition, and appears to have written some portions from the notes of Allefonsce.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>
The part of the <i>Cosmographie</i> applying to the North Atlantic coast begins with a description
of the Island of St. John and Cape Breton. Three points south of Cape Breton, if
not a fourth, are defined in connection with that cape. We read: “Turning to the Isle
of St. John, called Cape Breton, the outermost part of which is in the ocean in 45° from
the Arctic pole, I say Cape of St. John, called Cape Breton, and the Cape of the Franciscans,
are northeast and southwest, and there is in the course one hundred and forty
leagues; and here it makes a cape called the Cape of Norumbega. The said cape is by 41°
from the height of the Arctic pole.” For the writer to call Cape Breton by another name
is consistent with old usage.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> Where, however, it is said, “here it makes a cape,” the
language is obscure, as the writer seems to mean that on this coast there is a cape
between the Franciscan Cape and Cape Breton, since on the map the Franciscan Cape is
placed south of the Bay of the Isles, which the description places south of the Cape of
Norumbega. The latter cape is not laid down on the map; but we have there the River
of Norumbega, north of which is “Une partie de la Coste de la Norombegue,” while south
of the river is “Terra de la Franciscaine.” The Cape of Norumbega should therefore
have been marked on the map at the southern extremity of the Norumbega coast, near the
Bay of the Isles. “Cap de la Franciscaine” would then stand for Cape Cod. If this
interpretation is correct, the clause, “the said cape is by 41° from the height of the
Arctic pole,” would denote the Franciscan cape.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p>The next descriptive paragraph gives a clear idea of the region south of Cape Norumbega:
“Beyond the Cape of Noroveregue descends the river of said Noroveregue, about
twenty-five leagues from the cape. The said river is more than forty leagues wide at its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
entrance, and continues inwardly thus wide full thirty or forty leagues, and is all full of
islands that extend quite ten or twelve leagues into the sea, and is very dangerous on
account of rocks and shoals.”<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> Here we have a clear representation of the Penobscot
region, the writer taking the bay for the entrance to the river, as others did in later times.
He also says that “fifteen leagues within this river is a city called Norombergue.” According
to the old notion, he thought the Norumbega River extended to Canada, as in the
map of Ramusio, which is substantially true. Taking up his account of the coast, the
writer says: “From the River of Norombergue the coast runs to the west-southwest
quite two hundred leagues, to a large bay which enters the land about twenty leagues, and
is full twenty-nine leagues wide; and within this gulf there are four islands joined the one
to the other. The entrance to the Gulf is 38° from the height of the Arctic pole, and
the said isles are in 39 and a half degrees. And I have not seen the end of this Gulf, and
I do not know whether it passes beyond.” Here he does not appear to be making an
allusion to the great bay in 42° N. (<i>ante</i>, p. 60), but he has now reached the vicinity of
the Franciscan Cape, or Cape Cod, and speaks of the mouth of Long Island Sound and
contiguous openings, in connection with the great islands that stretch along the coast
southwest of Cape Cod. He does not here mention the Franciscan Cape, before alluded
to, distant from the “Cape of St. John, called the Cape of the Franciscans,” one hundred
and forty leagues, but he indicates its situation by the islands and the Sound lying to
the southward; while in its place it will be observed that the printed <i>Cosmographie</i> also
identifies the region by means of the islands, and shows that the Franciscan Cape at one
point was high land,&mdash;evidently what is now known as the Highland of Cape Cod, which,
as the geological formation indicates, was even higher in the time of Allefonsce. He continues:
“From this gulf the coast turns west-northwest about forty-six leagues, and makes
here a great river of Fresh water, and there is at its entrance an island of sand. The said
island is 39° from the height of the Arctic pole.” He is now speaking of the region of the
Hudson and Sandy Hook, though the latitudes are incorrect, as was usual with writers of
that time; while the courses and distances are equally confused. Nevertheless we have
a general and recognizable description of the main features of the coast between Cape
Breton and Sandy Hook, though in the printed <i>Cosmographie</i>, which is very brief, the
island of sand is not mentioned. Therefore, feeling certain of the correctness of our
position, minor errors and omissions may be left to take care of themselves. The principal
points, Cape Breton, Cape Sable, Cape Cod, and the Hudson, are unmistakably
indicated in the <i>routier</i>, though in the maps of Allefonsce, as in most of the maps of the
day, essential features are not delineated with any approach to accuracy, the great
peninsula of Nova Scotia, terminating in Cape Sable, for instance, having no recognizable
definition. Yet he dwells upon the fierceness of the tides, and says that when the strong
northeast winds blow, the seas “roar horribly.” This is precisely the case on the shoals
of Georges and Nantucket, where the meeting of waves and tides, even in a dead calm,
produces an uproar that is sometimes deafening.</p>

<p>At this point we may obtain a confirmation of the manuscript description from the
printed work. The account says: “Having passed the Isle of Saint Jehan, the coast
turns to the west and west-southwest as far as the River Norombergue, newly discovered<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>
by the Portuguese, which is in the thirtieth degree.” After describing the river and its
inhabitants, he says: “Thence the coast turns south-southwest more than two hundred
leagues, as far as a cape which is high land (<i>un cap qui est haute terre</i>), and has a great
island of low land and three or four little islands;”<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> after which he drops the subject and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
hastens down the coast to the West Indies. Here, however, we have the same cape that
we find in the manuscript, which is there called the Franciscan Cape, or our present Cape
Cod, beyond which are the islands Nantucket, Martha’s Vineyard, and the Elizabeth
group, joined one to the other almost like beads on a string, as we see them on the
modern map.</p>

<p>Here, however, it should be pointed out that, apparently in the lifetime of Francis I.,
the portion of <i>Voyages avantureux</i> which describes the North American coast was
turned into metrical form by Jehan Maillard, “poet royal;” and thus, long before Morrell
wrote his poetical description of New England, our coast from Newfoundland to Sandy
Hook was described in French verse, Maillard being the first writer to pay a tribute of
the kind.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> This person was a contemporary of Allefonsce and Cartier, and possibly he
was connected with Roberval, as Parmenius, the learned Hungarian of Buda, was connected
with Sir Humphrey Gilbert in his expedition of 1585, who went for the express
purpose of singing the praise of Norumbega in Latin verse.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> In his dedication he refers
to Cartier. These verses, like the printed book, contain the points which are not made in
the manuscript of Allefonsce.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Again, in our manuscript we find the writer going down the coast from Sandy Hook
to Florida, describing, in a somewhat confused way, Cape Henlopen and Delaware Bay,
with its white cliff (<i>fallaise blanche</i>), so conspicuous at the entrance to-day. Thus
both the printed book and the manuscript make three divisions of the coast between Cape
Breton and Florida, and show a general knowledge of essential features.</p>

<p>Hakluyt<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> gives a section from the original work of Allefonsce, to which he appears
to have had access. The heading runs: “Here followeth the course from Belle Isle, Carpont,
and the Grand Bay in Newfoundland, vp the riuer of Canada for the space of 230
leagues, obserued by Iohn Alphonse of Xanctoigne, chiefe Pilot to Monsieur Roberual,
1542.” This piece was translated from the French, and in one place Hakluyt makes
Allefonsce say: “By the nature of the climate the lands toward Hockelaga are still better
and better, and more fruitful; and this land is fit for figges and peares. I think that
gold and silver will be found here.” This, however, is a mistranslation, or at least it
does not agree with the manuscript in the Bibliothèque Nationale, which may be rendered,
“These lands, extending to Hochelaga, are much better and warmer than those of
Canada, and this land of Hochelaga extends to Figuier and Peru, in which silver and gold
abound.”<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> Under the direction of the Quebec Literary and Historical Society, the English
version found in Hakluyt was turned back into French, as the existence of the Paris
manuscript was not known to the editors; and in the <i>Voyages des déscouvertes au Canada</i>
(p. 86) we read: “Et cette terre peut produire des Figuee et des Poires.” In this, however,
they were encouraged by the statement found in all three versions of the first voyage
of Cartier, which say that at Gaspé the land produced figs.</p>

<p>Allefonsce confines his description chiefly to the route pursued by him in his voyage
with Roberval, though he speaks of the neighborhood of Gaspé and Chaleur; while he
calls the Island of Assumption “L’Ascentyon.” He also says of the Saguenay, “Two or
three leagues within the entrance it begins to grow wider and wider, and it seems to be
an arm of the sea; and I think that the same runs into the Sea of Cathay.”<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<p>We turn finally to the cartology of the voyages under consideration, which, however, it
is not proposed to treat here at much length, the subject being well-nigh inexhaustible.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<p>In the order of the Court of St. Malo, already referred to,<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> made on the remonstrance
of Cartier, we find that in March, 1533, he was charged with the responsibility of a voyage
to the New Lands, the route selected being that of “the strait of the Bay of the Castle,”
now the Strait of Belle Isle. The existence of the Bay of St. Lawrence was evidently
known to Cartier. He must have learned something of the region through the contemporary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
fishing voyages of the French. He could have inferred nothing, however, from the
map of Ruysch, 1508, which made Newfoundland a part of Asia; though the Reinel map,
1505, and the Portuguese map (1520), given by Kunstmann, show the Straits of Belle Isle
and the entrance to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, between Cape Breton and Newfoundland.
The anonymous map of 1527, published by Dr. Kohl, with the Ribero map (1529), show
both straits; though when Ribero copied that map and made some additions, he substantially
closed them up.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> On the Verrazano map of 1529 the straits were indicated as
open. The Maijolla map of 1527, though a Verrazano map, gives a deep indenture, but no
indication of an opening beyond. It was, nevertheless, clear enough to Cartier at this
time that the straits entering north and south of Newfoundland led either to another
strait or to a large bay. Maps of the Gulf must have existed in Dieppe at the period of
his voyage, though, owing to the desire of the various cities to gain a monopoly of the
New World trade, he may not have obtained much information from that Norman port.
Cartier seems to have made maps representing his explorations. There is a brief description
of one map contained in the letter of Jacques Noel, his grandnephew, written from
St. Malo in 1587 to Mr. John Grote, at Paris. In this map Canada was well delineated,
but it has now disappeared.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></p>

<p>What may have been known popularly of Newfoundland at the time of Cartier’s first
voyage is shown by the Maijolla map (1527), the map of Verrazano (1529), and the
map of Gaspar Viegas (1534).<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> The latter shows a part of Newfoundland, and the Cape
Breton entrance to the Gulf of St. Lawrence is simply the mouth of a <i>cul-de-sac</i>, into
which empty two streams,&mdash;“R. dos Poblas” and “Rio pria,”&mdash;indicating that the
Portuguese may have entered the Gulf. On the New Brunswick coast is “S. Paulo,”&mdash;a
name that Cartier is erroneously represented as giving in 1535, at which time Cartier found
the name in use, probably seeing it on some chart. The Island of Cape Breton is laid
down distinctly, but we can hardly make “Rio pria” do duty for the St. Lawrence. The
Maijolla map (1527) shows “C. Paulo.” A map now preserved in the Bodleian, given
by Kohl,<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> and bearing date of “1536, die Martii,” shows a dotted line running from
Europe to Cathay, and passing through an open strait north of Newfoundland. The map
of Agnese (1536) makes no mention of Cartier.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p>Oviedo,<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> in his description of the coast in 1537, shows no knowledge of the Gulf. He
mentions an Island of St. John, but this lay out in the Atlantic near Cape Breton, close
to the Straits of Canso. Nevertheless he gives a description of the four coasts of Cape
Breton Island. Afterward describing Newfoundland out of Ribero, he puts an Island of
St. John on the east coast near Belle Isle,<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> while in a corresponding position we see on
Ribero’s map, as published by Kohl, the Island of “S. Juan.”<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> Mercator’s rare map of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
1538<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> exhibits Newfoundland as circumnavigated, the southern part being composed of
broken islands, named “Insule Corterealis.” Canada is “Baccalearum regio,” and North
America is “Americæ,” or “Hispania major, capta anno 1530.” A strait, “Fretum
arcticum,” runs north of Labrador to the Pacific.</p>

<p>The Ptolemy published at Basle in 1540 shows a knowledge of Cartier’s second voyage,
Canada being called “Francisca;” while in the gulf behind Newfoundland, called
“Cortereali,” is a broad river like the St. Lawrence, extending into the continent.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, at this period many of the maps and globes bore no recognition of Cartier.
A Spanish globe, for instance, of about 1540 shows no trace of Cartier, though
behind Newfoundland&mdash;reduced to a collection of small islands&mdash;is a great gulf indented
with deep bays, one being marked “Rio de Penico,” which may stand for the
St. Lawrence, and thus represent
the alleged Portuguese
exploration of the Gulf by
Alvarez Fagundes anterior
to Cartier.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

<p>The map of Mercator published
at Louvain in 1541 indicates
no new discovery of
the French. Newfoundland
appears as in the sketch of
1538, but in the Gulf, represented
by a broad strait, we
find, “C. das paras,” “R.
compredo,” and “R. da
Baia.” The island of Cape
Breton bears the legend, “C.
de teenedus bretoys.”</p>

<p>Next in order, perhaps,
come the sketches of Jean
Allefonsce, pilot of Roberval,
who sailed with him for Canada,
Aug. 22, 1541. Of his
maps we have four examples
relating to the Gulf of St.
Lawrence and the North.
Like the rest of his sketches,
they are intercalated in his
manuscript. These particular
sketches are found on
folios 62, 179, 181, 183. Folio
62 represents Labrador and the regions to the north, with Iceland; folio 179 shows “La
Terra Neufe,” the southern part being an island, and Labrador cut in two by a broad
channel marked “La Bay d’au vennent les glaces,” which Allefonsce thought came out of
a fresh-water sea. Folio 181 has the Gulf of St. Lawrence, with Assumption Island<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
marked “L’Ascention.” He invariably makes this mistake.</p>

     <div class="cf"><p class="pc">ALLEFONSCE, FOL. 179.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The Gulf is called the Sea
of Canada (<i>Mer de Canada</i>). There are three inlets without names, representing Miramichi,
Chaleur, and Gaspé. The Gaspé region
is called “Terre Unguedor.” The mouth of the
St. Lawrence is shown; and near the entrance,
on the Labrador side, we find “La Terre de Sept
Isles.” There is an opening intended for Cartier’s
Bay of St. Lawrence; and farther eastward
is “Cap de Thienot,” so named by Cartier on his
first voyage, after the Indian chief found there.
Folio 183 indicates the Gulf again, as part of the
Sea of Canada (<i>Partie de la Mer de Canada</i>),
together with a portion of the St. Lawrence,
marked “Riviere du Canada.” Where the sketch
of folio 181 properly shows “Unguedor,” we find
“La Terre Franciscaine.” The Saguenay is
represented as a broad strait leading into a great
sea, “La Mer du Saguenay,” in which are three
islands. These
sketches, though
rude, possess
considerable interest,
as being
the first known
delineations of
the region made
on the spot by an
actual navigator;
but the Saguenay
region is sketched fancifully from hearsay.</p>

     <div class="cf"><p class="pc">ALLEFONSCE, FOL 181<sup>A</sup>.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In this connection we may mention Allefonsce’s
sketches of the Atlantic coast on folios 184, 186, 187 of
his <i>Cosmographie</i>. The first includes the entrance to the
Gulf and the southern part of Newfoundland. The entrance
is marked “Entree des Bretons.” The Island of
Cape Breton bears its proper name, with the Straits of
Canso clearly defined. Near its true locality in the Gulf,
but on too small a scale, we discover the “Isla de Saint-Jean,”
the “Isle Gazeas” of the map of Du Testu. The
New Brunswick section is styled, “One part of the Land
of the Laborer” (<i>Une partje de la Coaste du Laboureur</i>).<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>
Cape Race, Newfoundland, is called “Cap de Rat.”
Folio 186 shows the New England coast proper, with the
River of Norumbega, south of which is “Cap de la Franciscaine”
and “Terre de la Franciscaine.” The next section (187) includes the coast to
Florida, with the West Indies and part of South America.</p>

<p>It would prove interesting if one could establish the priority of Allefonsce in his application
of the name “Saint-Jean” to our present Prince Edward Island.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> The <i>Cosmographie</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
was finished in 1545, while the so-called Cabot map, which uses the same name, was
published in 1544. Now did Allefonsce adopt the name from this map of 1544? Clearly
the name was not given by Cartier, either
on his first or second voyage. On his
third voyage he does not appear to have
sailed on that side of the Gulf, while we
have no details of the fourth voyage.
He, however, gave the name of St. John
to a cape on the west coast of Newfoundland
during his first voyage. Allefonsce
called Prince Edward Island
by that name. A full discussion of this
subject might involve a fresh inquiry
into the authenticity of the Cabot map,
and expunge “Prima Vista.”</p>

<p>The globe of Ulpius, 1542, does not
recognize the voyages of Cartier, showing
Canada as the “Baccalearum Regio,”
with openings in the coast north
and south of Newfoundland, called
“Terra Laboratores.” North America
appears as a part of Asia.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> The Nancy
globe, which also shows North America
as connected with Asia, indicates that
the insular character of Newfoundland,
called “Corterealis,” was well known at
the time of its construction, about 1542.
From the gulf behind the island&mdash;the
southern part of which is much broken&mdash;two
rivers extend some distance into
the continent.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> These globes are according
to the prevailing French idea of
the period, making New France, as
Francis I. expressed it, a part of Asia. The map of Jean Rotz, 1542, shows the explorations
of Cartier, but omits the names that belong on the Gulf and River of St.
Lawrence.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<p>The Vallard map 1544 (?) shows very fully the discoveries of Cartier, his French names
being corrupted by the Portuguese map-makers, who promptly obtained a report of all that
Cartier had done. The Gulf and River of St. Lawrence appear simply as “Rio de Canada.”<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p>

<p>In 1544 we reach the famous Cabot map,<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> drawn from French material, fully illustrating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the French discoveries in Canada, and practically ignoring the claims of Spain, though
the alleged author was in the service of that country. This appears to be the first publication,
and in fact the first recognition in a printed form, of the voyages of Cartier and
Roberval, the narrative
of Cartier’s second voyage
not appearing until
the following year.</p>

<p>Next, we find in the
map of the Dauphin,
or Henri II. (1546),
that Roberval is recognized
standing with his
soldiers in martial array
on the bank of the
Saguenay. Newfoundland
is represented as
a mass of islands,&mdash;an
idea not dissipated by the voyages of Cartier; but the Gulf and River of St. Lawrence are
well depicted, and show the explorations of the sailor of St. Malo. We see the Island of
Assumption (our Anticosti), the Island of St. John (Alezay), Brion’s Island, and the Bird
Rocks, with many of
the names actually
given to points of the
coast by Cartier,
which shows that he
did his work with
care, yet without attempting
to affix
names to either the
gulf or the river, giving
to the latter in his
narrative the Indian
name “Hochelaga.” On this map<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> the name of “St. Laurens” stands where Cartier put
it on his first voyage, at the St. John’s River, though the name very soon&mdash;we cannot
say when&mdash;was applied to the Gulf, as to-day. Gomara styles it San Lorenço in 1553.
The <i>Isolario</i> of Bordone (1549) has no recognition of Roberval or Cartier, repeating the
map found in the edition of 1527.</p>

</div></div>

<p>In this connection the map of Gastaldi (1550) is somewhat remarkable. Publishing it
in 1556, in the third volume of his <i>Raccolta</i> in connection with the “Discorso d’vn
Gran Capitano,” supposed to have been written in 1539, Ramusio says that he is aware
of its deficiencies. This map, as well as the “Discorso,” makes no reference to Cartier,
though the country is called “<span class="smcap">La Nvova Francia</span>.” The map gives a lively picture of
the region. Norumbega appears as an island, and Newfoundland as a collection of large
islands, with evidences of what may stand for explorations in the Gulf lying behind; but,
unlike the globe just mentioned, it shows no names on the coast of the Gulf.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> The insular
character of the Norumbega region is not purely imaginary, but is based upon the fact
that the Penobscot region affords almost a continued watercourse to the St. Lawrence,
which was travelled by the Maine Indians.</p>

<p>A map of Guillaume le Testu (1555),<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> preserved in the Department of the Marine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
at Paris, exhibits very fully the work of Cartier. He uses both the names “Francica”
and “Le Canada.” To the Island of Prince Edward, one cape of which Cartier called
“Alezay,” he calls “Isle Gazees.” The map marked xi. in Kunstmann’s <i>Atlas</i> appears
to apply “I: allezai” to the same island.</p>

<p>Diego Homem’s map (1558), in the British Museum, also shows the explorations of
Cartier, though, in a poor and disjointed way, representing the Northern Ocean as extending
down to the region of the St. Lawrence, and as being connected therewith by several
broad passages. Mercator (given by Jomard) reveals the discoveries of Cartier in a more
sober way, though he puts “Honguedo” at the Saguenay instead of at Gaspé.</p>

<p>Here some notice should perhaps be taken of a map drawn in the year 1559,&mdash;the
year 967 of the Hegira,&mdash;by the Tunisian, Hagi Ahmed, who was addicted to the study of
geography in his youth, and who, while temporarily a slave among Christians, acquired
much knowledge which afterwards proved very serviceable. This map is cordiform, and
engraved on wood. It is described in the <i>Bulletin de la Société de Géographie</i> (1865, pp.
686-757). A delineation in outline is also given, though this representation affords only
a faint idea of its contents. It was found in the archives of the Council of Ten, and was
discussed by the Abbé Assemani in 1795. He was awarded a gold medal by the Prince
of Venice, who caused it to be struck in his honor. His treatise was limited to twenty-four
copies, which were accompanied by an equal number of copies of the map. The name
“Hagi” indicates that Ahmed had made the holy pilgrimage to Mecca. The photograph<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>
of it measures 16½ × 16 inches, the representation of the earth’s surface being bordered by
descriptive text inclosed in scroll work. Only two and one half inches are devoted to the
coast from Labrador to Florida; the work, accordingly, being very minute, is difficult to
examine even under a lens. The coast is depicted according to Ribero; the Gulf of St.
Lawrence not being shown, though deep indentations mark the two entrances. He does
not appear to have had access to any good charts, and shows a poor knowledge of what
Cartier had done.</p>

<p>The map of Nicholas des Liens, of Dieppe (1566), which is a map of the world, preserved
under glass in the Geographical Department of the Bibliothèque Nationale, gives
on a small scale a curious representation of Cartier’s exploration; the St. Lawrence as far
as Quebec being a broad gulf, one arm of which extends southwest, nearly to what represents
the New England coast. Along Lower Canada is spread out the name “Jacques
Cartier.”</p>

<p>Mercator’s map of 1569 makes some improvement upon the Dauphin’s map of 1546,
showing Cape Breton more in its true relation to the continent; while Newfoundland is
comprised in fewer fragments. North America and the lands to the north are dominated
by imagination; and in this map we find the source of much of that confusion which the
power of Mercator’s name extended far into the seventeenth century.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> Mercator does not
give any additional facts respecting the explorations of Cartier.</p>

<p>The general map in the Ptolemy of 1574, by Ruscelli, shows North America connected
with both Asia and Europe, Greenland being joined with the latter. Another map in
this volume, showing the coast from Florida to Labrador, presents Newfoundland in the
old way as a collection of islands, with three unnamed rivers extending into the main at
the westward.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p>

<p>Ortelius, in 1575, fashioned his map of the world after Mercator, and shows “Juan”
out in the sea off Cape Breton; while in his special map of America, farther out, we find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>“Juan de Sump<sup>o</sup>” in the place of Mercator’s “Juan Estevan.”<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p>The map of Thevet, given in his <i>Cosmographie Universelle</i>, 1575, adds little to the
interest of the discussion, as for the most part he follows Mercator, the master of the
period. On reaching the year 1584, the map of Jacques de Vaulx is found to show no
improvement over its immediate predecessors. The Gulf of St. Lawrence appears under
its present name, and the river, which is very wide, extends to Chilaga. The Penobscot
River runs through to the St. Lawrence, while a large island, called “L’Isle St. Jehan,”
lies in the sea along the coast which occupies the region where we should look for a
definition of the peninsula of Nova Scotia.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> On Lower Canada we read, “Terre Neufe.”
Newfoundland appears almost as a single island.</p>

<p>Porcacchi’s work, <i>L’Isole piv Famose del Mondo</i> of 1590 (p. 161), goes backward in
a hopeless manner. A river extends from the region of Nova Scotia into a great lake
(Lago) near “Ochelaga,” the latter being nearly the only word on the map distinctly
recalling the voyages of Cartier.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p>The map of De Bry, 1596, gives no light; though out at sea, off Cape Breton, is the
island “Fagundas.”<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> Wytfliet’s <i>Descriptionis Ptolemaicæ</i>, etc., of 1597, contains the same

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>The Molyneux map of 1600, among other points, shows Allefonsce’s Sea of Saguenay,
saying, “The Lake of Tadenac [Tadousac?], the boundes whereof are unknown.”<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> On
this map Newfoundland appears as one solid island, while the Penobscot extends through
to the St. Lawrence, which itself flows westward into the great “Lake of Tadenac, the

<p>Here we close our brief notice of a few of the representative maps produced prior to
the opening of the seventeenth century. A careful examination of these maps would show,
that, from the period of the Dauphin Map down to the first voyage of Champlain to
Canada, in 1603, no substantial improvement was made by the cartographers of any nation
in the geographical delineation of the region opened to France by the enterprise of Cartier
and those who followed him. As we have shown (<i>ante</i>, p. 61), the connection with New
France was maintained, vast profits being derived from the fisheries and from trade; but
scientific exploration appears to have been neglected, while the maps in many cases
became hopelessly confused. It was the work of Champlain to bring order out of confusion;
and by his well-directed explorations to restore the knowledge which to the world
at large had been lost, carrying out at the same time upon a larger scale the arduous
enterprises projected by Jacques Cartier.</p>

<p>During the few years immediately following
the explorations of Cartier we find
little or no trace of his discoveries. There
is scarcely any significance, for instance,
in the Agnese map of 1536,<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> the Apianus

earlier page.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> A little more precision comes
with the group of islands standing for the Newfoundland region, which appears in the
early Mercator map of 1538 and in the gores of Mercator’s globe of 1541,<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> and in the
Nancy globe of about the same date; but the Ulpius globe (1542) is uncertain enough,
and has the names confused.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>We first begin to trace a sensible effect of Cartier’s voyage in a manuscript in the
British Museum<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> indorsed, <i>This Boke of Idrography is made by me, Johne Rotz, Sarvant
to the Kinges Mooste Excellent Majestie</i>. The author
was a Frenchman of Flemish name, and his treatise is dated
1542. Harrisse<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> thinks that he used the Portuguese-Dieppe
authorities; and Kohl thinks that he must have had access to
the maps, now lost, which Cartier brought home from his first
voyage, while along the Gulf of Maine he depended upon the
Spanish accounts.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> Both of the sketches from Rotz here
given follow copies in the Kohl Collection; one is a section
from his map of the east coast of North America, and the other
is from his Western Hemisphere,&mdash;which seems to indicate
that he had in the interim between making the two maps got
tidings of Cartier’s later voyage.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></p>

<p>Baptista Agnese at Venice seems not to have been as fortunate
in getting knowledge of Cartier’s voyages as Rotz in
London was; and two or three of his charts, dated 1543, showing
this region, are preserved. They give a pretty clear notion
of the eastern coast of Newfoundland, with “C. Raso” and
“Terra de los Bretones” to the west of it.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> These Agnese

<p>We get at last, as has been said in the previous chapter, the first recognition in a
printed map of the Cartier voyages in the great Cabot map of 1544, of which a section is
here reproduced,<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> and a similar section is given by Harrisse in his <i>Cabots</i>, preserving the
colors of the original. Harrisse, by collating the references and early descriptions, reaches
the conclusion that there may have been three, and perhaps four, editions of this map, of
which a single copy of one edition is now known. Of the maps accompanying the manuscript
<i>Cosmographie</i> of Allefonsce, in the Paris Library, sufficient has been said in the
preceding text.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<p>None of these explorations prevented Münster, however, from neglecting, if he was
aware of, the newer views which the Cabot map had made public; and his eagerness for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the western passage dictated easily a way to the Moluccas in the “Typus universalis”
of his edition of Ptolemy in 1545.</p>

of the Spaniards, the <i>Arte de navegar</i> of Pedro de Medina, which was repeated in
his <i>Libro de grandezas y cosas memorables de España</i> of 1549. A sketch of this part of
the coast is annexed, and it will be seen that it betrays no adequate conception of what

</div></div>

<p>A map preserved in the British Museum belongs to this period. That library acquired
it in 1790, and its Catalogue fixes it before 1536; but Harrisse, because it does not give
the Saguenay, which Cartier explored in
his third voyage, places it after October,
1546. Harrisse thinks it is based on
Portuguese sources, with knowledge also
of Cartier’s discoveries.<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Kohl, in his Washington Collection,
has included a map by Joannes
Freire, of which a sketch is annexed. It
belonged to a manuscript portolano when
Kohl copied it, in the possession of Santarem,
which is described by Harrisse in
his <i>Cabots</i> (p. 220). Freire was a Portuguese
map-maker, who seems to have
used Spanish and French sources, besides
those of his own countrymen.</p>

<p>The New England coast belongs to a type well known at this time, and earlier; and if
the position of the legend about Cortereal has any significance, it places his exploration
farther south than is usually supposed. The names along the St. Lawrence are French,
with a trace of Portuguese,&mdash;“Angoulesme,” for instance, becoming “Golesma.”</p>

<p>Kohl placed in the same Collection another map of this region from an undated portolano

Freire; but it is in others so curious as to deserve record in the annexed sketch. Kohl
argues, from the absence of the St. Lawrence Gulf, that it records the observations of
Denys, of Honfleur, and the early fishermen.</p>

<p>The precise date of the so-called Nicolas Vallard map is not certain; for that name
and the date, 1547, may be the designation and time of ownership, rather than of its
making. The atlas containing it was once owned
by Prince Talleyrand, and belongs to the Sir
Thomas Phillipps Collection. Kohl has conjectured
that it is of Portuguese origin,<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> and includes

<p>Cesáreo Fernandez Duro, in his <i>Arca de
Noé; libro sexto de las disquisiciones náuticas</i>,
Madrid, 1881, gives a map of the St. Lawrence Gulf and River
of the sixteenth century. It was found in a volume relating to
the Jesuits in the Library of the Royal Academy of History at Madrid, and was produced
in fac-simile in connection with Duro’s paper on the discovery of Newfoundland
and the early whale and cod fisheries,&mdash;particularly by the Basques. The date of
the chart is too indefinitely fixed to be of much use in reference to the progress of
discovery. Harrisse<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> is inclined to put its date after the close of the century, even so
late as 1603.</p>

<p>Intelligence of Cartier’s tracks had hardly spread as yet into Italy, judging from
the map of Gastaldi in the Italian Ptolemy of 1548. Mr. Brevoort<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> says of the sketch,&mdash;which
is annexed,&mdash;that it is a “draught entirely different from any previously published.
The materials for it were probably derived from Ramusio, who had collected original maps
to illustrate his Collection of Voyages, but who published very few of them. In this particular
map we find indications of Portuguese and French tracings, with but little from
Spanish ones.”</p>

<p>Gastaldi is thought to have made the general map which appears in Ramusio’s third
volume (1556), five or six years earlier, or in 1550. All that it shows for the geography of
the St. Lawrence Gulf and River is a depression in the coast nearly filled by a large
island. In 1550, and again in 1553, the Abbé Desceliers, who has already been shown to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
be the author of the Henri II. map, made portolanos which are of the same size, and bear
similar inscriptions: (1) “<i>Faicte a Arques par Pierres Desceliers, P. Bre: lan 1550</i>; and
(2) <i>Faicte a Arques par Pierre Desceliers, Prebstre</i>, 1553.”</p>

<p>Harrisse<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> thinks that
the praise bestowed upon
Desceliers as the creator
of French hydrography is
undeserved, as the excellence
of the maps of his
time presupposes a long
line of tentative, and even
good, work in cartography;
and he holds that
Portuguese influence is apparent from the early part of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>Wuttke, in his “Geschichte der Erdkunde,”<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> describes and figures several manuscript
American maps from the Collection in the Palazzo Riccardi at Florence, dated 1550 or
thereabout; but they add nothing to our knowledge respecting the region we are considering.
One makes a large gulf in the northeast of North America, and puts “Terra di la
S. Berton” on its east side, and “Ispagna Nova” on the west. This gulf has a different
shape in two other of the maps, and disappears in some. In one there is a gulf prolonged
to the west in the far north.</p>

<p>At about this date we may place a curious French map, communicated by Jomard to
Kohl, and included by the latter in his Washington Collection. A sketch of it is annexed.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>
It is manuscript, and bears neither name nor date. The extreme northeastern part resembles
Rotz’s map of 1542, and the explorations of Cartier and Roberval seem to be
embodied. The breaking-up of Newfoundland would connect it with Gastaldi’s maps, or
the information upon which Gastaldi worked, while the names on its outer coast are of
Portuguese origin, with now a Spanish and now a French guise. Farther south the coast
seems borrowed from the Spanish maps. The large river emptying into the St. Lawrence
from the south is something unusual on maps of a date previous to Champlain. If it is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Sorel, Champlain’s discovery of the lake known by his name was nearly anticipated. If it
is the Chaudière, it would seem to indicate at an early day the possibilities of the passage
by the portage made famous by Arnold in 1775, and of which some inkling seems to have
been had in the union of the St. Lawrence and the Gulf of Maine not infrequently shown
in the early maps. The most marked feature of the map, however, is the insularity of the
continent, with a connection of the Western Ocean somewhere apparently in the latitude
of South Carolina, similar to that shown in John White’s map, as depicted in the preceding
chapter. It may, of course, have grown out of a belief in the Sea of Verrazano; or it
may have simply been a geographical gloss put upon Indian
reports of great waters west of the limit of Cartier’s
expedition.</p>

<p>Another popular American map by Bellero was used
in the Antwerp <i>Gomara</i> of 1554, and in several other
publications issuing from that city.<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> It was not more
satisfactory, as the annexed sketch shows,&mdash;which indicates
that even in Antwerp the full extent of Cartier’s explorations was not suspected.
Nor had Baptista Agnese divined it in his atlas of the same year, preserved in the Biblioteca
Marciana at Venice. Our sketch is taken from the fifth sheet as given in a photographic
fac-simile<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> issued at Venice in 1881, under the editing of Professor Theodor

<p>An elaborate portolano <i>Cosmographie universelle, par Guillaume Le Testu</i>, and dated in
1555, is described by Harrisse<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> as an adaptation of a Portuguese atlas, with the addition
of some French names. The northern regions of North America are called <i>Francia</i>.</p>

<p>In 1556, in the third volume of
Ramusio’s <i>Navigationi et viaggi</i>,<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>
Gastaldi, excelling a little his Ptolemy
map of 1548,&mdash;a sketch of
which is given on p. 88,&mdash;produced
his <i>Terra de Labrador et Nova
Francia</i>; while for the accounts
which Ramusio now printed of
Cartier’s voyage, Gastaldi added
the <i>Terra de Hochelaga nella Nova
Francia</i>,&mdash;which was simply a
bird’s-eye view of an Indian camp.<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></p>

<p>In the same year (1556) the map of Volpellio was not less deceptive. Two years
later (1558) we find an atlas in the British Museum, the work of Diego Homem, a Portuguese
cartographer, which seems to indicate other information than that afforded by
Cartier’s voyages. It is not so accurate as regards the St. Lawrence as earlier maps are,
but shows additional knowledge of the Bay of Fundy, which comes out for the first time,
and is not again so correctly drawn till we get down to Lescarbot, half a century later.</p>

<p>A mere passing mention may be made of a large engraved map of America, of Spanish
origin, “Auctore Diego Gutierro, Phillipi regis cosmographo,” dated 1562, because of its

<p>The atlas of Baptista Agnese of 1564, preserved in the British Museum,<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> and another
of his of the same date in the Biblioteca Marciana, still retain some of the features of his
earlier portolanos. He always identifies Greenland with Baccalaos, and still represents
Newfoundland as a part of the main. Harrisse holds that he had not advanced beyond
the Toreno (Venice) map of 1534, and in 1564 knew little more of the Newfoundland
region than was known to Ribero and Chaves thirty-five years earlier.</p>

Gastaldi’s map, and is, perhaps, the same one credited to Forlani under 1570, as
showing the recent discoveries in Canada. It is contained in the so-called Roman atlas
of Lafreri, <i>Tavole moderne di geografia</i>, Rome and Venice, 1554-1572.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></p>

<p>Next in chronological order comes an engraved map (15½ × 10½) with the following
title: <i>Il disegno del discoperto della Nova Franza ... Venetijs aeneis formis Bolognini
Zalterij, Anno M.D. LXVI</i>.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> It gives the whole breadth of the continent, and is very
erroneous in the eastern parts. The “R. S. Lorenzo” runs southeast from a large lake
into the ocean between Lacadia and Baccalaos, while Ochelaga and Stadaconi<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> are on a
river running east farther to the north, whose headwaters are in a region called “Canada.”
The island C. Berton, as well as Sable Island (Y. Darena), would seem to indicate that
the coast to the north of them is intended for the modern Nova Scotia, which would make
the river running from the lake the Penobscot, and the group of islands east of Baccalaos
a disjointed Newfoundland, compelling the river rising near Canada to do duty for the St.
Lawrence. The large island, “Gamas,” is perhaps a reminiscence of Gomez.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> The map
in these parts is so confused, however, that its chief interest is to illustrate the strange
commingling of error and truth, “which we have received lately,” as the inscription reads,
“from the latest explorations of the French,”&mdash;which must, if it means anything, refer to
Roberval. The map has signs neither of latitude nor longitude. In general contour it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
resembles other Italian maps of this time, like those of Forlani, Porcacchi, etc. Zaltieri
differs from Forlani, however, in separating America from Asia.</p>

<p>The great mappemonde of Gerard Mercator, introducing his well-known projection,
followed in 1569. The annexed sketch indicates its important bearing on a portion of
North American cartography. The St. Lawrence is extended much farther inland than
ever before, with no signs of the Great Lakes, and it is made to rise in the southerly part
of the region, put in modern maps west of the Mississippi, among mountains which also
form a watershed westerly to the Gulf of California and southerly to the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p>Kohl<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> sums up his essay on this map as follows: “It is a remarkable fact, that while
the icy seas and coasts of Greenland, Labrador, Newfoundland, and Canada were depicted
on the maps of the sixteenth century with a high degree of truth, our coasts of New England
and New York were badly drawn so late as 1569; and their cartography remained
very defective through nearly the whole of the sixteenth century.”</p>

<p>A close resemblance to Mercator is seen in the rendering of Ortelius in the first (1570)
edition of his <i>Theatrum orbis terrarum</i>.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> The contour and general details of North<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
America, as established by Mercator and Ortelius, became a type much copied in the later
years of the sixteenth century. The woodcut map in Thevet’s <i>Cosmographie universelle</i>
(1575), for instance, is chiefly based on Ortelius, though Thevet claimed to have based it
on personal observation in 1556.<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>

<p>The maps in De la Popellinière’s <i>Les trois mondes</i> (1582), that of Cornelius Judæus
(1589), those in Maffeius’s <i>Historiarum Indicarum libri xvi.</i> (1593), in Magninus’s <i>Geographia</i>
(1597), and in Münster’s <i>Cosmographia</i> (1598),&mdash;all follow this type. Reference
may also be made to a Spanish mappemonde of 1573 which is figured in Lelewel,<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> an
engraved Spanish map in the British Museum, evidently based on Ortelius, and assigned
by the Museum authorities to 1600; but Kohl, who has a copy in his Washington Collection,
thinks it is probably earlier. A similar westward prolongation of the St. Lawrence
River is found in a “Typus orbis terrarum,” dated 1574, which, with a smaller map of
similar character, appeared in the <i>Enchiridion Philippi Gallæi, per Hugonem Favolium</i>,
Antwerp, 1585. Quite another view prevailed at the same time with other geographers,
and also became a type, as seen in the map given by Porcacchi as “Mondo nuovo” in his
<i>L’ isole piu famose del mondo</i>, published at Venice in 1572, in which he mixes geographical
traits and names in a curious manner. It is not easy to trace the origin of some of this
cartographer’s points.</p>

<p>A theory of connecting the Atlantic and the St. Lawrence on the line of what is apparently
the Hudson River, which had been advanced by Ruscelli in the general map of the
world in the 1561 edition of Ptolemy, was developed in 1578 by Martines in his map of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>

sketch here given follows Dr. Kohl’s copy in his Washington Collection. Dee used
mainly Spanish authorities, as many of his names signify; and though he was a little too

<p>The peculiarities of three engraved English maps of about this time are not easy to
trace. The first map is that in Sir Humphrey Gilbert’s <i>Discourse</i>;<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> the second is the

nearly to the latest knowledge.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

<p>We find what is perhaps the latest instance of New France being made to constitute

knowledge in his
well-known map of the
world. So far as the
St. Lawrence Valley
goes, it was not much
different from the type
which Ortelius had established
in 1570. Blundeville,
in his <i>Exercises</i>
(1622, p. 523), describing
Plancius’ map,
speaks of it as “lately
put forth in the yeere of
our Lord 1592;” but in
the Dutch edition of
Linschoten in 1596 it is
inscribed: <i>Orbis terrarum

Hakluyt had used in his 1589 edition. This was the work of Arnoldus Florentius à

de Judæis in lucem edita, 1593,” which appeared in that year in his <i>Speculum orbis
terrarum</i>, Mercator and Ortelius seem to be the source of much of its Arctic geography;
but its Lake Conibas, with its fresh water, records very likely some Indian story of the
Great Lakes lying away up the Ottawa,&mdash;which is presumably the river rising in the Saguenay
country. A legend on the map says that its fresh water is of an extent unknown to
the Canadians, who are, as another legend says, the nations filling up the country from
Baccalaos to Florida.</p>

<p>The map by Mathias Quaden, or Quadus, in the <i>Geographisches Handbuch</i>, was published
at Cologne in 1600, bearing the title, “Novi orbis pars borealis.” The northeastern
parts seem to be based on Mercator and Ortelius. A marginal note at “Corterealis”
defines that navigator’s explorations as extending north to the point of what is called
Estotilant. In its Lake Conibas it follows the 1593 map of Judæis.</p>

maps of the latter part of the century which have been omitted, are, perhaps, the <i>Erdglobus</i>

with the same maps, in Langenes’ <i>Handboek van alle landen</i>, edited by Viverius, published
at Amsterdam in 1609. In 1618 a French edition of Bertius was issued by Hondius
at Amsterdam with an entirely new set of maps, including a general map of America and
one of “Nova Francia et Virginia.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="pc1 mid">CHAMPLAIN.</p>

<p class="pc1">BY THE REV. EDMUND F. SLAFTER.</p>


<p class="drop-cap04">FROM 1603 to 1635 the ruling spirit and prominent figure in French
exploration and colonization in America was Samuel de Champlain.
His temperament and character, as well as his education and early associations,
fitted him for his destined career. His home in the little town of
Brouage, in Saintonge, offered to his early years more or less acquaintance
with military and commercial life. He acquired a mastery of the science
of navigation and cartography according to the best methods of that
period. His knowledge of the art of pictorial representation was imperfect,
but nevertheless useful to him in the construction of his numerous
maps and topographical illustrations. He wrote the French language with
clearness, and without provincial disfigurement. Several years in the army
as quartermaster gave him valuable lessons and rich experience in many
departments of business. Two years in the West Indies, visiting not only
its numerous Spanish settlements, including the City of Mexico on the
northern and New Grenada on the southern continent, gave him an intimate
and thorough knowledge of Spanish colonization.</p>

<p>With such a preparation as this, at the age of thirty-five or thirty-six,
Champlain entered, in a subordinate position, upon his earliest voyage to
the Atlantic coast of North America. During the preceding sixty years
the French had taken little interest in discovery, and had made no progress
in colonization, though their trade on the coast may have been kept up.<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

<p>In 1603, Amyar de Chastes, a venerable governor of Dieppe, conceived
the idea of planting a colony in the New World, of removing thither his
family, and of finishing there his earthly career. He accordingly obtained
from Henry IV. a commission; and, associating with himself in the enterprise
several merchants, he sent out an expedition to make a general survey,
to fix upon a suitable place for a settlement, and to determine what
provision would be necessary for the accommodation of his colony. De
Chastes invited Champlain to accompany this expedition. No proposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
could have been more agreeable to his tastes. He accepted it with alacrity,
provided, however, the assent of the King should first be obtained. This
permission was readily accorded by Henry IV., but was coupled with the
command that he should bring back a careful and detailed report of his
explorations. Champlain was thus made the geographer of the King. It
is doubtless from this appointment, unsought, unexpected, and almost accidental,
that we are favored with Champlain’s unparalleled journals, which
have come down to us rich in incident, prolific in important information,
and covering nearly the whole period of his subsequent career.</p>

<p>The expedition set on foot by Amyar de Chastes left Honfleur on the
15th of March, 1603. It consisted of two vessels, one commanded by
Pont Gravé, a distinguished fur-trader and merchant, who had previously
made several voyages to the New World, and the other by Sieur Prevert,
both of them from the city of St. Malo. Two Indians, who had been
brought to France by Pont Gravé on a former voyage, accompanied the
expedition, and made themselves useful in the investigation which ensued.
Delayed by gales lasting many days, and by floating fields of ice sometimes
fifteen or twenty miles in extent, the company were forty days in reaching
the harbor of Tadoussac. Here, a short distance from their anchorage,
they found encamped a large number of savages, estimated at a thousand,
who were celebrating a recent victory. These savages were representatives
from the three great allied northern families or tribes,&mdash;the Etechemins of
New Brunswick and Maine, the Montagnais of the northern banks of the
St. Lawrence about Tadoussac, and the Algonquins, coming from the vast
region watered by the Ottawa and its tributaries. They had just returned
from a conflict with the Iroquois near the mouth of the Richelieu. War
between these tribes was of long standing. All traditions as to its beginning
are shadowy and obscure; but it had clearly been in progress several
generations, and probably several centuries, renewing its horrors in unceasing
revenge and in constantly recurring cruelties. For the thirty years
which Champlain was yet to spend as the neighbor of these tribes such
hostile encounters were, as we shall see, a continual obstacle to his plans
and a steady source of anxiety.</p>

<p>On the arrival at Tadoussac, preparations were at once made for an
exploration of the St. Lawrence. While these were in progress, Champlain
explored the Saguenay for the distance of thirty or forty miles, noting its
extraordinary character, its profound depth, its rapid current, and impressed
with the lofty and sterile mountains between whose perpendicular walls its
pent-up waters had forced their way, moving down to the ocean with a
heavy and irresistible flood. This survey of the Saguenay was probably
the first ever made by a European explorer. At all events, Champlain’s
description is the earliest which has come down to us.</p>

<p>On the 18th of June, leaving Tadoussac in a barque, and taking with
them a skiff made expressly for ascending rapids and penetrating shallow
streams, Champlain, Pont Gravé, and a complement of sailors, with several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Indians as guides and assistants, proceeded up the St. Lawrence. From
Tadoussac to Montreal they explored the bays and tributary rivers, observing
the character of the soil, the forests, the animal and vegetable products,
including all the elements of present and prospective wealth. On
reaching the Lachine Rapids above Montreal, their progress was abruptly
terminated. Neither their barque nor their skiff could stem the current.
They continued on foot along the shore for several miles, but soon found it
inexpedient with their present equipment to proceed farther. Having
obtained from the Indians important, if not very definite, information concerning
the country, rivers, and lakes above the falls, and having likewise
learned from them that in the lake region far to the north native copper
existed and had been fabricated into articles of ornament, they returned
to Tadoussac.</p>

<p>Champlain immediately organized another party to examine the southern
shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Skirting along the coast, they touched
at Gaspé, Mal-Bay, and Isle Percée, which were at that time (1603) important
stations, annually visited by fishermen of different nations. Soon
after reaching the southern coast they met a troop of savages who were
transporting arrows and moose-meat to exchange for the skins of the
beaver and marten with the more northern tribes whom they expected to
find at Tadoussac. Having obtained such information as they desired of
the country still farther south, and of the copper mines in the region about
the Bay of Fundy, Champlain’s party passed directly from Gaspé to the
northern side of the Gulf, touching somewhere near the Seven Islands, and
thence coasted along the inhospitable shores of the northern side till they
reached the harbor of Tadoussac. Having completed their explorations
and secured a valuable cargo of furs, which was a subordinate purpose of
the expedition, they returned to France, arriving at Havre de Grâce on the
20th of September, 1603.</p>

<p>On their arrival Champlain received the painful news of the death of
Amyar de Chastes, under whose auspices the expedition had been sent out.
This put an end to the present scheme of a colonial plantation.</p>

<p>Champlain applied himself immediately to the preparation of an elaborate
report of his explorations, and in a few months it was printed under
the sanction of the King and given to the public. This book proved of
importance at that early stage of French colonization in America; it
covered, indeed, nearly the same ground which had been gone over by
Cartier sixty years before. But the survey had been more exact and
thorough; for he had observed more of the harbors and penetrated more
of the tributaries both of the river and of the gulf. The pictures which he
presented were more completely drawn, and detailed more accurately the
sources of wealth, while they conveyed the practical information which was
needed by those who were about to embark in the colonization of the New
World. This fresh statement of Champlain, virtually with the royal commendation,
awakened in the public mind, as might well be expected, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
new interest, and enterprising merchants in different cities of France were
not wanting who were ready to invest their means in the new undertaking.</p>

<p>This union of colonization and mercantile adventure was incongruous in
itself, and proved a constant impediment to settlements. The merchant
made his investments for no reason but to obtain immediate returns in large
dividends. On such conditions of profit, money for the necessary outlays
could be obtained, but upon no other. This put into the hand of the
merchant or adventurer a power which he exercised almost entirely for
his own advantage. What was necessary for the prosperity of the colony
which he seemed to be founding, he absorbed in frequent and excessive
dividends. The avarice of the merchant thus hampered the true colonial
spirit, and his demands consumed the profits which should have given solid
strength and expansion to the colony. This condition was a constant
source of annoyance and discouragement to Champlain, and against it he
found it necessary to contend throughout his whole career, but with not
very satisfactory results.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></p>

<p>It was two months after the return of this first Canadian voyage of
Champlain when the commission was granted to the Sieur de Monts of
which an account is given in the following chapter. De Monts had succeeded
in forming an association of merchants, who were lured by the prospects
of the profits of the fur-trade. Taking himself the charge of one of
his vessels, of one hundred and fifty tons, and putting Pont Gravé over the
other, of one hundred and twenty tons, accompanied by several noblemen,
among whom was Poutrincourt, and with Champlain still in the capacity
of geographer of the King, they led forth their company of one hundred
and twenty men,&mdash;laborers, artisans, and soldiers,&mdash;of whom about two
thirds were to remain as colonists.</p>

<p>De Monts, who had been in the Gulf of St. Lawrence with De Chauvin
several years before, decided to seek out a suitable location for his colony
in a milder climate, which he could well do without going beyond the limits
of his grant. The expedition reached the shores of Nova Scotia early in
May, where they captured and confiscated several vessels engaged in a contraband
fur-trade. Pont Gravé proceeded through the Strait of Canseau
to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, in order to prosecute more successfully the
fur-trade, by which the expenses of the outfit were to be met.</p>

<p>Champlain’s duties as an explorer and geographer began at once. He
proceeded in a barque of about eight tons, accompanied by several gentlemen,
sailing in advance of the vessel, exploring the southern coast of the
peninsula of Nova Scotia, touching at numerous points, visiting the harbors
and headlands, giving them names, and making drawings, until he reached
St. Mary’s Bay, within the opening of the Bay of Fundy, where he discovered
several mines of silver and iron. Subsequently having been joined
by De Monts, continuing his examinations, he entered Annapolis Harbor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
crept along the western shore of Nova Scotia, and passing over to New
Brunswick, skirted the whole of its southern coast, and entered the Harbor
of St. John; then exploring Passamaquoddy Bay as far as the mouth of
the River St. Croix, he finally reached the island which the patentee
selected as the seat of his new colony.</p>

<p>Champlain&mdash;undoubtedly the best engineer in the party&mdash;was immediately
directed to lay out the grounds and fix upon the situation and
arrangement of the buildings, which were forthwith erected.<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a></p>

<p>This settlement, here and at Port Royal,<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> under the charter of De Monts,
continued for three years, making, as might well be expected, but little progress
as a colony, the principal achievement being the cultivation of some
small patches of ground, the raising of a few specimens of European grains,
and of garden vegetables for its own use. It has consequently very little
historical significance in itself. But it served in the mean time a very important
purpose as a base, necessary and convenient, for the extensive
explorations made by Champlain on the Atlantic coast, stretching from
Canseau, at the eastern extremity of Nova Scotia, to the Vineyard Sound,
on the southern shores of Massachusetts. These geographical surveys occupied
him three summers, while the intervening winters were employed
in executing a general chart of the whole region, together with many local
maps of the numerous bays, harbors, and rivers along the coast.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></p>

<p>The first of these surveys was made during the month of September,
1604. This expedition was under the sole direction of Champlain, and was
made in a barque of seventeen or eighteen tons, manned by twelve sailors,
and with two Indians as guides. He examined the coast from the mouth
of the St. Croix to the Penobscot. He was especially interested in the
beautiful islands which fringe the coast, particularly in Mount Desert and
Isle Haute, to which he gave the names which they still bear. Sailing up
the Penobscot, called by the Indians the Pentegöet, and by Europeans who
had passed along the coast the Norumbegue, he explored this river to
the head of tide-water, at the site of the present city of Bangor, where a fall
in the river intercepted his progress. In the interior, along the shores of
the river, he saw scarcely any inhabitants; and by a very careful examination
he was satisfied beyond a doubt that the story, which had gained currency
from a period as far back as the time of Alfonse, about a large
native town in the vicinity, whose inhabitants had attained to some of the
higher arts of civilization, was wholly without foundation. He not only
saw no such town, but could find no remains or other evidence that one
had ever existed. Having spent nearly a month in his explorations, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
obtained a good knowledge of the country and much information as to
the inhabitants, when having exhausted his provisions, he returned to his
winter quarters at De Monts’ Island.</p>

<p>The next expedition was made early in the following summer, after it had
been decided to abandon the island. Accordingly, on the 18th of June, 1605,
De Monts himself, with Champlain as geographer, several gentlemen and
twenty sailors, together with an Indian and his wife, necessary guides and interpreters,
set sail for the purpose of finding a more eligible situation somewhere
on the shores of the present New England. Passing along the coast
which had been explored the preceding autumn, they soon came to the
mouth of the Kennebec. Entering this river, and bearing to the easterly
side, they sailed through a tidal creek, now called Back River, into the
waters of the Sheepscot, and passing round the southern point of Westport
Island, skirting its eastern shore, they came to the site of the present
town of Wiscasset. Lingering a short time, exchanging courtesies
with a band of Indians assembled there, and entering into a friendly alliance
with them, they proceeded down the western shores of Westport, and
passing through the Sasanoa, again entered the Kennebec, and sailed up
as far as Merrymeeting Bay, where, by their conference with the Indians
whom they met in the Sheepscot, they were led to believe they should
meet Marchin and Sasinou, two famous chiefs of that region, whose friendship
it was good policy to secure. Failing of this interview, they returned
by a direct course to the mouth of the Kennebec.</p>

<p>Champlain having made a sketch of the mouth of the river, the islands
and sandbars, with the course and depth of the main channel, the party
moved on towards the west. Examining the coast as they proceeded, they
passed without observing the excellent harbor of Portland, concealed as it
is by the beautiful islands clustering about it, and next entered the bay of
the Saco, which stretches from Cape Elizabeth to Fletcher’s Neck. Here
they observed strong contrasts between the natives and those of the coast
farther east. Their habits, mode of life, and language were all different.
Hitherto the Indians whom they had seen were nomadic, living wholly
by fishing and the chase. Here they were sedentary, and subsisted mainly
on the products of the soil. Their settlement was surrounded by fine fields
of Indian corn, gardens of squashes, beans, and pumpkins, and ample
patches of tobacco. They observed also on the bank of the river a fort,
which was made of lofty palisades. After tarrying two days in this bay,
making ample sketches of the whole, including the islands, the place now
known as Old Orchard Beach, and the dwellings on the shore, and having
bestowed on the natives some small presents as tokens of gratitude
for cordial and friendly entertainment, the French, on the 12th July,
once more weighed anchor. Keeping close in, following the sinuosities
of the shore, and lingering here and there, they observed everything
as they passed, and on the morning of the 16th arrived at Cape Anne.</p>

This promontory has usually been called Manomet,

it has the correct bearing from the Gurnet; but
it is in that case very strange that so marked
a feature as the sand-spit known as Plymouth
Beach is not indicated, and no sign is given of
the conspicuous eminence known as Captain’s
Hill. If, however, we consider the top of the
map north (and the engraver may be accountable
for the erroneous fashioning of the points
of the compass), it becomes at once perfectly
comprehensible as a sketch of that part of the
bay known as Duxbury Harbor, and would not,
accordingly, show that part of the shore on
which the Pilgrims landed. In this view the
hill <i>I</i> becomes Captain’s Hill, and the rest of
the plan, though but rudely conforming to the
lines of Duxbury Harbor, is much more satisfactory
in its topographical correspondences
than the other theory would allow. See the
modern map of the harbor in Vol. III. chap. viii.

<p class="pf400">It will be remembered that the French found
in all this region populous communities, which
had been greatly reduced or destroyed by a
plague in 1616 and 1617, before the English
made their settlements. Mr. Adams has grouped
the authorities on this point in his Morton’s

coast for some years. We have accounts
of two of their ships, at least, which were
lost there between 1614 and 1619,&mdash;one on
Cape Cod, two of whose crew were reclaimed
by Dermer (Bradford’s <i>Plymouth Plantation</i>,
98), and the other in Boston Harbor, whose
crew were killed. Cf. 4 <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>,

<p>Their stay here was brief, its chief feature being an interview with the
natives, whom they found cordial and highly intelligent. The Indians
made an accurate drawing, with a crayon furnished by Champlain, of the
outline of Massachusetts Bay, and indicated correctly their six tribes and
chiefs by as many pebbles, which they skilfully arranged for the purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>Holding short interviews with the natives at different points, threading
their way among the islands which besprinkle the bay, many of which, as
well as ample fields on the mainland, were covered with waving corn, they
sailed into Boston Harbor. The next day they proceeded along the south
shore, and on the 19th entered and made such survey as they could of the
little bay of Plymouth, destined a few years later to become the seat of the
first permanent English settlement in New England. Besides a description
of the Indian methods and implements of fishing, in which vocation he found
them engaged, and of the harbor and its surroundings, Champlain has left
us a sketch of the bay, to which he gave the name of Port St. Louis. This
sketch is certainly creditable, when we bear in mind that it was made without
surveys or measurements of any kind, and during a hasty visit of a few
hours. Leaving Plymouth Harbor, and keeping along the coast, they made
the complete circuit of the bay, and rounding the point of Cape Cod they
sailed in a southerly direction, and entered an insignificant tidal inlet now
known as Nauset Harbor. Here they lingered several days, making inland
excursions, gathering much valuable information relating to the Indians,
their mode of dress, ornamentation, the structure of their dwellings, the
preparation of their food, and the cultivation of the soil. These particulars
did not differ essentially from what they had observed at Saco, on
the coast of Maine, and indicated clearly that the people belonged to the
same great family.</p>

<p>Their provisions being nearly exhausted, it now became necessary to
turn back. On reaching the mouth of the Kennebec, they learned that an
English ship had been anchored at the island of Monhegan, which proved to
be the “Archangel,” in command of Captain George Weymouth, who was
making an exploration on the coast at that time, under the patronage of
the Earl of Southampton. The conflicting claims of the French and English
to the territory which Champlain was now exploring will come into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
prominence later in our story. On arriving at De Monts Island, it became
necessary to hasten arrangements for the removal of the colony to a situation
less exposed; but in all the explorations thus far made they had found
no location which was in all respects satisfactory for a permanent settlement.
They determined, therefore, to transfer the colony at once to
Annapolis Basin, where the climate was milder and the situation better
protected. The buildings were forthwith taken down and transported
to the new site. De Monts, the governor, soon after departed for France,
in order to obtain from the King assistance in establishing and enlarging
the domain of his colony. The command in his absence was placed in the
hands of Pont Gravé. Champlain determined also to remain, in the hope
of “making new explorations towards Florida.”</p>

<p>During the early autumn Champlain made an excursion across the bay
to St. John, whence, piloted by an Indian chief of that place, he visited
Advocate’s Harbor, near the head of the Bay of Fundy, in search of a
copper mine. A few small bits of that metal, which was all he found,
offered little inducement for further search.</p>

<p>The colony, in their new quarters at Port Royal, suffered less from the
severity of the climate during the winter than they had done on the preceding
one at De Monts Island. Nevertheless the dreaded <i>mal de la terre</i>, or
scurvy, made its appearance, and twelve out of the forty-five settlers died
of that disease. Early in the spring several attempts were made to continue
their explorations along the southern coast; but, much to their disappointment,
they were as often driven back by disastrous storms. The supplies
needed for the succeeding winter were much delayed, and did not come
till late in July, when De Poutrincourt arrived as lieutenant of De Monts,
and took command at Port Royal.</p>

<p>On the 5th of September an expedition under De Poutrincourt, together
with Champlain as geographer, departed to continue their explorations.<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a>
It was Champlain’s opinion that they should sail directly for Nauset Harbor,
where their previous examinations had terminated, and from that
point make a careful survey of the coast farther south. Had his counsels
prevailed, they might, during the season, have completed the exploration
of the whole New England coast. But De Poutrincourt desired
to examine personally what had already been explored by previous expeditions.
In this re-survey they discovered Gloucester Harbor, which they
had not seen before. They found it spacious, well protected, with good
depth of water, surrounded by attractive scenery, and therefore named it
<i>Le Beauport</i>, the beautiful harbor. It was fringed with the dwellings and
gardens of two hundred natives. In their mode of life they were sedentary,
like those at Saco and at Boston, and they gave their guests a friendly
welcome, offering them the products of the soil,&mdash;grapes just from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
vines, squashes of different varieties, the trailing-bean which is still cultivated
in New England, and the Jerusalem artichoke, fresh and crisp, the product
of their industry and care. After several days at Gloucester, the voyagers
proceeded on their course, and finally rounded Cape Cod, touched again
at Nauset, and after infinite trouble and no less danger crept round Monomoy
Point and entered Chatham Harbor, where they found it necessary to
remain some days for the repair of their disabled barque. From Chatham
as a base they made numerous inland excursions, and also sailed along
the shore as far as the Vineyard Sound, which was the southern terminus
of Champlain’s explorations on the coast of New England. The work
of exploration having thus been completed, spreading their sails for the
homeward voyage, touching at many points on their way, they reached
Annapolis Harbor on the 14th of November.</p>

<p>The winter that followed was employed by the colonists in such minor
enterprises as might seem to bear on their future prospects. Near the
end of the following May a ship arrived from France bringing a letter from
De Monts, the patentee, stating that by order of the King his monopoly
of the fur-trade had been abolished, and directing the immediate return
of the colony to France. The cause of this sudden reverse of fortune to
De Monts, of this withdrawal of his exclusive right to the fur-trade, is easily
explained. The seizure and confiscation of several ships and their valuable
cargoes on the coast of Nova Scotia had awakened a personal hostility in
influential circles, and they easily represented that the monopoly of De
Monts was destroying an important branch of national commerce, and diverting
to the emolument of a private gentleman revenues which belonged
to the State.</p>

<p>Preparations for the return to France were undertaken without delay.
Meanwhile two excursions were made, one, accompanied by Lescarbot the
historian, to St. John and to the seat of the first settlement at De Monts
Island; another, under De Poutrincourt, accompanied by Champlain, to the
head of the Bay of Fundy. The bulk of the colonists left near the end
of July, in several barques, to rendezvous at Canseau, while De Poutrincourt
and Champlain remained till the 11th of August, when they followed
in a shallop, keeping close to the shore, which gave Champlain an opportunity
to examine the coast from La Hève to Canseau,&mdash;the last of his
explorations on the Atlantic coast.</p>

<p>As the geographer of the King, Champlain had been engaged in his
specific duties three years and nearly four months. His was altogether
pioneer work. At this time there was not a European settlement of any
kind on the eastern borders of North America, from Newfoundland on the
north to Mexico on the south. No exploration of any significance of the
vast region traversed by him had then been made. Gosnold and Pring had
touched the coast; but their brief stay and imperfect and shadowy notes
are to the historian tantalizing and only faintly instructive.<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> Other navigators<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
had indeed passed along the shore, sighting the headlands of Cape
Anne and Cape Cod, and had observed some of the wide-stretching bays
and the outflow of the larger rivers;<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> but none of them had attempted even
a hasty exploration. Champlain’s surveys, stretching over more than a
thousand miles of sea-coast, are ample, and approximately accurate. It
would seem that his local as well as his general maps depended simply on
the observations of a careful eye; of necessity they lacked the measurements
of an elaborate survey. Of their kind they are creditable examples,
and evince a certain ready skill. The nature and products of the soil, the
wild, teeming life of forest and field, are pictured in his text with minuteness
and conscientious care. His descriptions of the natives, their mode
of life, their dress, their occupations, their homes, their intercourse with
each other, their domestic and civil institutions as far as they had any, are
clear and well defined, and as the earliest on record, having been made
before Indian life became modified by intercourse with Europeans, will
always be regarded by the historian as of the highest importance.</p>

<p>On the 3d of September, 1607, the colonists, having assembled by
agreement at Canseau, embarked for France, and arrived at St. Malo early
in October. Champlain hastened to lay before De Monts the results of his
explorations, together with his maps and drawings. The zeal of De Monts
was rekindled by the recital, notwithstanding the losses he had sustained
and the disappointments he had encountered. Specimens of grain, corn,
wheat, rye, barley, and oats, together with two or three braces of the beautiful
brant goose, which had been bred from the shell, were presented to the
King as products of New France and as an earnest of its future wealth.
Henry IV. was not insensible to the merits of the faithful De Monts, and
he granted him a renewal of his monopoly of the fur-trade, but only for
a single year. With this limitation of his privilege, stimulated by the futile
hope of getting it extended at its expiration, De Monts fitted out two
vessels,&mdash;one to be commanded by Pont Gravé, and devoted exclusively
to the fur-trade, while the other was to be employed in transporting men
and material for a settlement or plantation on the River St. Lawrence. Of
this expedition Champlain was constituted lieutenant-governor,&mdash;an office
which he subsequently continued to hold in New France, with little interruption,
till his death in 1635.</p>

<p>On the 13th of April, 1608, he left Honfleur, and arrived at Tadoussac
on the 3d of June. Here he found Pont Gravé, who had preceded
him, in serious trouble. A Basque fur-trader and whale-fisherman, who
did not choose to be restrained in his trade, had attacked him, killed one
of his men, severely wounded Pont Gravé himself, and taken possession
of his armament. The illegal character of this proceeding and its utter
disregard of the King’s commission clearly merited immediate and severe
punishment. While the Governor was greatly annoyed, he did not, however,
allow passion to warp his judgment or overcome the dictates of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
reason. The punishment, so richly deserved, could not be administered
without the sacrifice of all his plans for the present year. With a characteristic
prudence he therefore decided, “in order not to make a bad
cause out of a just one,” to use his own expression, upon a compromise,
by referring the final settlement to the authorities in France, with the assurance,
in the mean time, that there should be no further interference by
either party with the other.</p>

<p>Having constructed a small barque of about fourteen tons, and taken
on board a complement of men and such material as was needed for his
settlement, he proceeded up the River St. Lawrence. On the fourth day
the French approached the lofty headland jutting out upon the river and
forcing it into a narrow channel, to which, on account of this narrowing, the

<p>The remaining part of the season was employed
in establishing his colony, in felling the forest trees, in excavating cellars,
erecting buildings, in laying out and preparing gardens, and in the necessary
preparations for the coming winter. Among the events to occupy
the attention of the Governor early after their arrival was the suppression
of a conspiracy among his men which aimed at his assassination, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
seizure of the property of the settlement, and the conversion of it to their
own use. Proceeding cautiously in eliciting all the facts, Champlain got the
approbation of the officers of the vessels and others, and condemned four
of the men to be hanged. The sentence was executed upon the leader at
once, while the other three were sent back to France for a review and confirmation
of their sentence in the courts. This prompt exercise of authority
had a salutary effect, and good order was permanently established. The
winter was severe and trying, especially to the constitutions of men unaccustomed
to the intense cold of that region, and disease setting in, twenty
of the twenty-eight which comprised their whole number died before the
middle of April. The suffering of the sick, the mortality which followed,
the starving savages who dragged their famishing and feeble bodies about
the settlement, and whose wants could be but partially supplied, produced
a depression and gloom which can hardly be adequately pictured.</p>

<p>Early in June, 1609, Pont Gravé returned from France with supplies and
men for the settlement. The colony, even thus augmented, was small;
and under the system on which it was established and was to be maintained,
there was little assurance that it would be greatly enlarged. During the
first twenty-five years its whole number did not probably at any time much
exceed one hundred persons. While there was a constant struggle to enlarge
its borders and increase its numbers, it was in fact only a respectable
trading-post, maintained at a limited expense for the economical and
successful conduct of the fur-trade. The responsibility of the Lieutenant-Governor
was mostly confined to maintaining order in this little community,
and in giving the men occupation in the gardens and small fields which
were put under cultivation, and in packing and shipping peltry during the
season of trade. For a man of the character, capacity, and practical sense
of Champlain, this was a mere bagatelle. He naturally and properly
looked forward to the time when New France should become a strong and
populous nation. Its territorial extent was at present unknown. The channel
only of the St. Lawrence, including the narrow margin that could
be seen from the prow of the barque as it sailed along its shore from
Tadoussac to the Lachine Rapids, had been explored. A vast continent
stretched away in the distance, shrouded in dark forests, diversified with
deep rivers and broad lakes, concerning which nothing whatever was known,
except that which might be gathered from the shadowy representations of
the wild men roaming in its solitudes. To know the capabilities of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
mysterious, unmeasured domain; to learn the history, character, and relations
of the differing tribes by whom it was inhabited,&mdash;was the day-dream
of Champlain’s vigorous and active mind. But to attain this was not an
easy task. It required
patience, discretion, endurance
of hardship
and danger, a brave
spirit, and an indomitable
will. With these
qualities Champlain was
richly endowed, and
from his natural love of
useful adventure, and
his experience in exploration,
he was at all
times ready and eager
to push his investigations
into these new regions
and among these
pre-historic tribes.</p>

<p>During the winter
Champlain had learned
from the Indians who
came to the settlement
that far to the southwest
there existed a
large lake, whose waters
were dotted with beautiful
islands, and whose
shores were surrounded
by lofty mountains and
fertile valleys. An opportunity
to explore
this lake and the river
by which its waters were
drained into the St.
Lawrence was eagerly
coveted by Champlain.
This region occupied a
peculiar relation to the
hostile tribes on the
north and those on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
south of the St. Lawrence. It was the battle-field, or war-path, where they
had for many generations, on each returning summer, met in bloody conflict.
The territory between these contending tribes was neutral ground. Mutual
fear had kept it open and uninhabited. The Montagnais in the neighborhood
of Quebec were quite ready to conduct Champlain on this exploration,
but it was nevertheless on the condition that he should assist them in an
attack upon these enemies if encountered on the lake. To this he acceded
without hesitation. It is possible that he did not appreciate the consequences
of assuming such a hostile attitude toward the Iroquois; but it is
probable that he was influenced by a broad national policy, to which we
shall revert in the sequel.</p>

<p>After numerous delays and adjustments
and readjustments of plans, when the expedition was fairly afloat on
the River Richelieu it consisted of sixty warriors in bark canoes, clad in their
usual armor, accompanied by Champlain and two French arquebusiers.
Proceeding up the river, they entered the lake, coursed its western shore,
and moved tardily along. At the expiration of nearly three weeks,&mdash;on the
29th of July, 1609,&mdash;in the shade of the evening, they discovered a flotilla
of bark canoes containing about two hundred Iroquois warriors of the
Mohawk tribe, who were searching for their enemies, the tribes of the
north, whom they hoped to find on this old war-path. Early the next
morning, on the present site of Ticonderoga, near where the French subsequently
erected Fort Carillon, whose ruins are still visible, the two parties met.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>

<p>It was the first exhibition of firearms which the savages had ever
witnessed. Champlain, moving at the head of his allies, discharged his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
arquebus, and by it two chiefs were instantly killed, and another savage fell
mortally wounded. The two French arquebusiers, attacking in flank, poured
also a deadly fire upon the astonished Mohawks. The strange noise of the
musketry, their comrades falling dead or wounded, and the deafening shout
of the victors, carried dismay into the Mohawk ranks. In utter consternation
they fled into the forest, abandoning their canoes, arms, provisions,
and implements of every sort. The joy of the victors was unbounded. In
three hours after the fight they had gathered up their booty, placed the ten
captives whom they had taken in their canoes, performed the customary
dance of victory, and were sailing down the lake on their homeward voyage.
They soon reached their destination, having lingered here and there to
inflict the usual inhuman punishments upon their poor prisoners of war.
The cruelties which they practised in the presence of Champlain were
abhorrent to his generous nature, and he used his utmost influence to mitigate
and soften the sufferings which he could not wholly avert.</p>

<p>The exploration which Champlain had thus conducted was interesting
and geographically important. He had made a hurried survey of the lake
extending nearly its whole length, and had observed its beautiful islands,
with its wooded shores flanked by the Adirondacks on the west and by
the Green Mountains on the east. From the mouth of the Richelieu he
had penetrated inland a hundred and fifty miles, and as the discoverer
he might justly claim that the whole domain, of which this line was the
radius, had by him been added to French dominion. To this exquisitely
fine expanse of water he gave his own name; and now, after the lapse of
two hundred and seventy-five years, it still bears the appellation of Lake
Champlain.</p>

<p>Soon after arriving at Quebec, Champlain made preparations to return
to France. Leaving the settlement in charge of a deputy, he arrived at
Honfleur on the 13th of October. He immediately laid before De Monts
and the King a full report of his discoveries and observations during the
past year, and to both of them it was gratifying and satisfactory. The
monopoly of the fur-trade which had been granted to De Monts had expired
by limitation, and he now sought for its renewal. The opposition,
however, was too powerful, and his efforts were fruitless. Nevertheless,
De Monts did not abandon his undertaking, but with a commendable
resolution and courage he renewed his contracts with the merchants of
Rouen, and in the spring of 1610 sent out two vessels to transport artisans
and supplies for the settlement, and to carry on the fur-trade. Champlain
was again appointed lieutenant for the government of the colony at
Quebec.</p>

<p>During this summer he was unable to undertake any explorations, although
two important ones had been projected the year before. One of them
was in the direction of Lake St. John and the headwaters of the Saguenay,
the other up the Ottawa and to the region of Lake Superior. The importance
of an early survey of these distant regions was obvious; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Indians were not ready for the undertaking, and without their friendly guidance
and assistance it was plainly impracticable. Early in the season the
Montagnais were on their way to the mouth of the Richelieu, where they
were to meet their allies, the Hurons and Algonquins, and proceed up the
river to Lake Champlain, and engage in their usual summer’s entertainment
of war with the Mohawks. Sending forward several barques for trading
purposes, Champlain repaired to the rendezvous, where he learned that the
Iroquois or Mohawks, nothing daunted by the experiences of the previous
year, had already arrived, and had thrown up a hasty intrenchment on the
shore, and were impatiently awaiting the fight. There was no delay; the
conflict was terrific. By the aid and advice of Champlain the rude fort was
demolished. Fifteen of the Mohawks were taken prisoners, others plunged
into the river and were drowned, and the rest perished by the arquebus
and the savage implements of war. Not one of the Mohawks escaped
to tell the story of their disaster.</p>

<p>Before the Algonquins from the Ottawa returned to their homes, Champlain
began a practice which proved of great value in after years. He
placed in the custody of the Indians a young man to accompany them to
their homes, pass the winter, learn their language, their mode of life, and
the numberless other things which can only be fully understood and appreciated
by an actual residence. On the other hand, a young savage was
taken to France and made familiar with the forms of civilized life. These
delegates of both parties became interpreters, and thus intercourse between
the French and Indians became easy and intelligent.</p>

<p>During the summer information was received of the assassination of
Henry IV. This was regarded as a great calamity. He had from the first
been friendly to those engaged in colonial enterprise, and they could fully
rely upon his sympathy, although his impoverished treasury did not permit
him to give that substantial aid which was really needed.</p>

<p>Champlain returned to France in the autumn of 1610, but again visited
Quebec in 1611, though only for the summer, which was devoted almost exclusively
to the management of the fur-trade. This trade was at best limited
and desultory. The French did not obtain their peltry by trapping, snaring,
or the chase, but by traffic with the savage tribes, who every summer visited
the St. Lawrence for this purpose. A small number of them appeared each
spring at Tadoussac, and a much larger number at Montreal, with their
bark canoes loaded with skins of the beaver and of other valuable fur-bearing
animals. Having no use for money or for such fabrics as are useful
and necessary in civilized life, the savages gladly exchanged the accumulations
of the winter, sometimes not reserving enough for their own clothing,
for such glittering trifles as were offered to their choice. To facilitate these
exchanges a rendezvous was established at Montreal, and when the flotilla
of canoes appeared in the river, the trade was completed in an incredibly
short time. As it was absolutely free and unrestricted, the competition became
excessive, and the balance-sheet of the merchants usually presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
an exceedingly small net profit, if not a considerable loss. This competition
was so disastrous, that the associates of De Monts decided to withdraw from
the enterprise, and sold to him their interest in the establishment at Quebec.
The formation of a new company was forthwith committed to Champlain.
He accordingly drew up a scheme, embracing, besides others, these two
important features: First, that the association should be presided over by
a viceroy of high position and commanding influence; this was supposed
to be important in settling any complications that might arise in France.
Second, that membership should be open to all merchants who might desire
to engage in trade in New France, sharing equally all profits and losses.
This was supposed to remove all objections to the association as a monopoly,
since membership was free to all. The Count de Soissons was appointed
viceroy. He died, however, a few weeks later, in the autumn of
1612, and the Prince de Condé, Henry de Bourbon II., was chosen his successor.
The organization of the Company, under many embarrassments,
notwithstanding the precautions which had been taken by Champlain, occupied
him during the whole of the year 1612. Having been appointed
lieutenant, he returned to New France in 1613, arriving at Quebec on the
7th of May of that year.</p>

<p>It had been from the beginning an ulterior object of the French in making
a settlement in North America to discover a northwest passage by water
to the Pacific Ocean. Whoever should make this discovery would, by
diminishing the distance to the markets of the East Indies, confer a boon of
untold commercial value upon his country, and earn for himself an imperishable
fame. This day-dream of all the old navigators had haunted the
mind of Champlain from the first. Every indication which pointed in that
direction was carefully considered. Nicholas de Vignau, one of the interpreters
who had passed a winter with the Algonquins on the upper waters
of the Ottawa, returned to France in 1613. Having heard doubtless something
of the disastrous voyage of Henry Hudson to the bay which bears his
name, he manufactured a fine story, all of which was spun from his own
brain, but was nevertheless well adapted to make a strong impression on
the mind of Champlain and others interested in this question. This bold
impostor stated that while with the Algonquins he had made an excursion
to the north, and had discovered a sea of salt water; that he had seen on its
shores the wreck of an English ship from which eighty men had been taken
and slain by the savages, and that the Indians had retained an English boy
to present to Champlain when he should visit them. Although the story
was plausible, Vignau was cross-examined, and put to various tests, and
finally made to certify to the truth of his statement before notaries at La
Rochelle. Champlain laid the statement before the Chancellor de Sillery,
the President Jeannin, and the Marshal de Brissac, and by them was
strongly advised to ascertain the truth of the story by a personal exploration.
He therefore resolved to make this a prominent feature of the
summer’s work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>Accordingly, with two bark canoes, provisions and arms, an Indian guide
and four Frenchmen, including De Vignau, Champlain proceeded up the
Ottawa. This river is distinguished by its numerous rapids and falls, many
of them impassable even by the light canoe;<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> and at that time the shores
were lined with dense and tangled forests, which could only be penetrated
with the utmost difficulty. After incredible fatigue and hunger, the party
at length arrived at Alumet Island, where they were kindly received by the
chief of the Indian settlement. Here De Vignau had passed a previous
winter, and was now obliged to confess his base and shameless falsehood.
The indignation of Champlain, as well as his disappointment, can well be
comprehended. He bore himself, however, with calmness, and restrained
the savages from taking the life of De Vignau, which they were anxious to
do for his audacious mendacity.</p>

<p>Although Champlain did not attain the object for which the journey
was undertaken, he had nevertheless explored an important river for more
than two hundred miles, and had made a favorable impression upon the
savages. On his return he was accompanied by a large number of them,
with eighty canoes loaded with valuable peltry for exchanges at the rendezvous
near Montreal. Having placed everything in order at Quebec, he
returned to France, where he remained during the whole of the year
1614, occupied largely in adding new members to his company of associates,
and in perfecting such plans as were necessary for the success of
the colony. Among the rest he secured several missionaries to accompany
him to New France, with the purpose of converting the Indians to
the Christian faith. These were Denis Jamay, Jean d’Olbeau, Joseph le
Caron, and the lay brother Pacifique du Plessis, Recollects of the Franciscan
order.</p>

<p>On his return in 1615, Champlain immediately erected a chapel at
Quebec, which was placed in charge of Denis Jamay and Pacifique du
Plessis, while Jean d’Olbeau assumed the mission of the Montagnais, and
Joseph le Caron that of the Hurons. Hastening to the rendezvous for
trade at Montreal, Champlain found the allied tribes awaiting him, and
anxious to engage him in a grand campaign against the Iroquois. It was
to be on a much more comprehensive scale than anything that had preceded
it, and was to be an attack on a large fort situated in the heart of the
present State of New York. This was distant not less than eight hundred
or a thousand miles by the circuitous journey which it was necessary to
make in reaching it. The warriors were to be collected and marshalled
from the various tribes whose homes were along the route. The undertaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
was not a small one. A journey, including the return, of fifteen hundred
or two thousand miles, by river and lake, through swamps and tangled
forests, with the incumbrance
of necessary baggage and a motley
crowd of several hundred savages
to be daily fed by the chance of
fishing and hunting, demanded a
brave heart and a strong will.</p>

        <p class="pf250">[This sketch-map follows one given by Mr.
O. H. Marshall in connection with a paper on
“Champlain’s Expedition of 1615” in the <i>Mag.
of Amer. Hist.</i>, August, 1878. It shows the
route believed by Mr. Marshall to be that of
Champlain from Quinté Bay, and the route suggested
by General John S. Clark, which is in
the main accepted by Dr. Shea.</p>
<p class="pf250">The route of Champlain and the site of the
fort attacked by him has occasioned a diversity
of views. Champlain’s own narrative, besides
making part of the English translation of his
works, is also translated in the <i>Doc. Hist. of
New York</i>, vol. iii., and in the <i>Mag. of Amer.
Hist.</i>, September, 1877, p. 561. Fac-similes of
the print of the fort, besides being in the works,
are also in the <i>Doc. Hist. of New York</i>, iii. 9;
Shea’s <i>Le Clercq</i>, i. 104; <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>,
September, 1877; Watson’s <i>History of Essex
County, N. Y.</i>, p. 22.</p>
<p class="pf250">Mr. Marshall began the discussion of these
questions as early as 1849 in the <i>New York Hist.
Soc. Proc.</i> for March of the same year, p. 96;
but gave the riper results of his study in the
<i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, vol. i., January, 1877, with
a fac-simile of Champlain’s 1632 map. His
views here were controverted in the same, September,
1877, by George Geddes, who placed the
fort on Onondaga Creek, and by Dr. J. G. Shea
in the <i>Pennsylvania Magazine of History</i>, ii. 103,
who substantially agreed with an address by
General J. S. Clark, which has not yet been
printed, but whose views are shared by Mr.
L. W. Ledyard, who in an address, Jan. 9, 1883,
at Cazenovia, N. Y., tells the story of his own
and General Clark’s investigation of the site
of the fort, and places it near Perryville, N. Y.
Dr. Shea, in his <i>Le Clercq</i>, i. 100, has since gone
over the authorities. It was in reply to Geddes,
Shea, and Clark that Mr. Marshall wrote the
paper from which the above sketch-map is taken.
Dr. O’Callaghan, in his <i>Documentary History
of New York</i>, iii. 16, had advanced the theory
that the fort was on Lake Canandaigua: and
to this view Mr. Parkman guardedly assented
in his <i>Pioneers</i>, and so marked the fort on his
map. Brodhead, <i>History of New York</i>, i. 69,
and Clark in his <i>History of Onondaga</i>, placed
it on Onondaga Lake. Cf. the <i>Transactions</i> of
the Literary and Historical Society of Quebec,

Voyages</i>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p>But it offered an opportunity for exploring
unknown regions which
Champlain could not bring himself
to decline. Accordingly, on
the 9th of July, 1615, Champlain
embarked with an interpreter, a
French servant, and ten savages, in
two birch-bark canoes. They ascended
the Ottawa, entered the Mattawan,
and by other waters reached
Lake Nipissing. Crossing this lake
and following the channel of French
River, they entered Lake Huron,
or the Georgian Bay, and coasted
along until they reached the present
county of Simcoe. Here they
found the missionary Le Caron,
who had preceded them. Eight
Frenchmen belonging to his company joined that of Champlain. The
mustering hosts of the savage warriors came in from every direction. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
length, crossing Lake Simcoe, by rivers and lakes and frequent portages
they reached Lake Ontario just as it merges into the River St. Lawrence,
and passing over to the New York side, they concealed their canoes
in a thicket near the shore, and proceeded by land; striking inland, crossing
the stream now known as Oneida River, they finally, on the 10th of
October, reached the great Iroquois fortress, situated a few miles south
of the eastern end of Oneida Lake. This fort was hexagonal in form, constructed
of four rows of palisades thirty feet in height, with a gallery near
the top, and water-spouts for the extinguishing of fire. It inclosed several
acres, and was a strong work of its kind. The attack of the allies was fierce
and desultory, without plan or system, notwithstanding Champlain’s efforts
to direct it. A considerable number of the Iroquois were killed by the
French firearms, and many were wounded; but no effective impression was
made upon the fortress. After lingering before the fort some days, the allies
began their retreat. Champlain, having been wounded, was transported in
a basket made for the purpose. Returning to the other side of Lake Ontario,
to a famous hunting-ground,&mdash;probably north of the present town of
Kingston,&mdash;they remained several weeks, capturing a large number of deer.
When the frosts of December had sealed up the ground, the streams, and
lakes, they returned to the home of the Hurons in Simcoe, dragging with
incredible labor their stores of venison through bog and fen and pathless
forest. Here Champlain passed the winter, making excursions to neighboring
Indian tribes, and studying their habits and character from his personal
observation, and writing out the results with great minuteness and detail.
As soon as the season was sufficiently advanced, Champlain began his journey
homeward by the circuitous route of his advance, and arrived safely after
an absence of nearly a year. Having put in execution plans for the repair
and enlargement of the buildings at Quebec, he returned to France.</p>

<p>For several years the trade in furs was conducted as usual, with occasional
changes both in the Company in France and in local management.
These, however, were of no very essential importance, and the details must
be passed by in this brief narrative. The ceaseless struggle for large dividends
and small expenditures on the part of the company of merchants
did not permit any considerable enlargement of the colony, or any improvements
which did not promise immediate returns. Repairs upon the buildings
and a new fort constructed on the brow of the precipice in the rear of
the settlement were carried forward tardily and grudgingly.<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> As a mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
trading-post it had undoubtedly been successful. The average number of
beaver skins annually purchased of the Indians and transported to France
was probably not far from fifteen or twenty thousand, and it sometimes
reached twenty-two thousand. The annual dividend of forty per cent on
the investment, as intimated by Champlain, must have been highly satisfactory
to the Company. The settlement maintained the character of a trading-post,
but hardly that of a colonial plantation. After the lapse of nearly
twenty years, the average number of colonists did not exceed much more
than fifty. This progress was not satisfactory to Champlain, to the Viceroy,
or to the Council of State. In 1627 a change became inevitable. Cardinal
de Richelieu had become grand master and chief of the navigation and
commerce of France. He saw the importance of rendering this colony
worthy of the fame and greatness of the nation under whose authority it
had been planted. Acting with characteristic promptness and decision, he
dissolved the old Company and instituted a new one, denominated <i>La Compagnie
de la Nouvelle France</i>, consisting of a hundred or more members, and
commonly known as the Company of the Hundred Associates. The constitution
of this society possessed several important features, which seemed
to assure the solid growth of the colony. Richelieu was its constituted
head. Its authority was to extend over the whole territory of New France
and Florida. Its capital was three hundred thousand livres. It proposed
to send to Canada in 1628 from two hundred to three hundred artisans of
all classes, and within the space of fifteen years to transport four thousand
colonists to New France. These were to be wholly supported by the Company
for three years, and after that they were to have assigned to them as
much land as was needed for cultivation. The settlers were to be natives
of France and exclusively of the Catholic faith, and no Huguenot was to
be allowed to enter the country. The Company was to have exclusive
control of trade, and all goods manufactured in New France were to be
free of imposts on exportation. Such were the more general and prominent
features of the association. In the spring of 1628 the Company, thus
organized, despatched four armed vessels to convoy a fleet of eighteen
transports, laden with emigrants and stores, together with one hundred and
thirty-five pieces of ordnance to fortify the settlement at Quebec.</p>

<p>War existing at that time between England and France, an English fleet
was already on its way to destroy the French colony at Quebec. The
transports and convoy sent out by the Company of the Hundred Associates
were intercepted on their way, carried into England, and confiscated.
On the arrival of the English at Tadoussac, David Kirke, the commander,
sent up a summons to Champlain at Quebec, demanding the surrender of the
town; this Champlain declined to do with such an air of assurance that the
English commander did not attempt to enforce his demand. The supplies
for the settlement having thus been cut off by the English, before the next
spring the colony was on the point of perishing by starvation. Half of them
had been billeted on Indian tribes to escape impending death. On the 19th
of July, 1629, three English vessels appeared before Quebec, and again demanded
its surrender. Destitute of provisions and of all means of defence,
with only a handful of famishing men, Champlain delivered up the post
without hesitation. All the movable property belonging to the Company
at Quebec was surrendered. The whole colony, with the exception of such
as preferred to remain, were transported to France by way of England. On
their arrival at Plymouth, it was ascertained that the war between the two
countries had come to an end, and that the articles of peace provided that
all conquests made subsequent to the 24th of April, 1629, were to be restored;
and consequently Quebec, and the peltry and other property taken
after that date, must be remanded to their former owners. Notwithstanding
this, Champlain was taken to London and held as a prisoner of war for
several weeks, during which time the base attempt was made to compel
him to pay a ransom for his freedom. Such illegal and unjust artifices
practised upon a man like Champlain of course came to nothing, except to
place upon the pages of history a fresh example of what the avarice of men
will lead them to do. After having been detained a month, Champlain was
permitted to depart for France.</p>

<p>The breaking-up of the settlement at Quebec just on the eve of the new
arrangement under the administration of the Hundred Associates, and
with greater prospect of success than had existed at any former period,
involved a loss which can hardly be estimated, and retarded for several
years the progress of the colony. The return of the property which had
been illegally seized and carried away gave infinite trouble and anxiety to
Champlain; and it was not until 1633 that he left France again, with a
large number of colonists, re-commissioned as governor, to join his little
colony at Quebec.<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> He was accompanied by the Jesuit Fathers Enemond
Massé and Jean de Brébeuf. The Governor and his associates received
at Quebec from the remnant of the colony a most hearty welcome. The
memory of what good he had done in the past awakened in them fresh
gratitude and a new zeal in his service. He addressed himself with his
old energy, but nevertheless with declining strength, to the duties of the
hour,&mdash;to the renovation and improvement of the habitation and fort, to
the holding of numerous councils with the Indians in the neighborhood,
and to the execution of plans for winning back the traffic of allied tribes.
The building of a chapel, named, in memory of the recovery of Quebec,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Notre Dame de Recouvrance, and such other kindred duties as sprang out
of the responsibilities of his charge, engaged his attention. In these occupations
two years soon passed.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1635 Champlain addressed a letter to Cardinal
de Richelieu, soliciting the means, and setting forth the importance of subduing
the hostile tribes known as the Five Nations, and bringing them
into sympathy and friendship with the French.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> This in his opinion was
necessary for the proper enlargement of the French domain and for the
opening of the whole continent to the influence of the Christian faith,&mdash;two
objects which seemed to him of paramount importance. This was probably
the last letter written by Champlain, and contains the key to the motives
which had influenced him from the beginning in joining the northern tribes
in their wars with the Iroquois.<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> On Christmas Day, the 25th of December,
1635, Champlain died in the little fort which he had erected on the rocky
promontory at Quebec, amid the tears and sorrows of the colony to which
for twenty-seven years he had devoted his strength and thought with rare
generosity and devotion.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> In the following June, Montmagny, a Knight of
Malta, arrived as the successor of Champlain.</p>

<h3><a name="c130" id="c130">CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION.</a></h3>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE richest source of information relating to Champlain’s achievements as a navigator,
explorer, and the founder of the French settlement in Canada is found in
his own writings. It was his habit to keep a journal of his observations, which he began
even on his voyage to the West Indies in 1599. Of his first voyage to Canada, in 1603,
his Journal appears to have been put to press in the last part of the same year. This
little book of eighty pages is entitled: <i>Des Savvages; ov, Voyage de Samvel Champlain,
de Brovage, faict en la France Nouuelle, l’an mil six cens trois. A Paris, chez Clavde
de Monstr’oeil, tenant sa boutique en la Cour du Palais, au nom de Jesus, 1604. Auec
priuilege du Roy.</i> This Journal contains a valuable narrative of the incidents of the
voyage across the Atlantic, and likewise a description of the Gulf and River St. Lawrence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
and enters fully into details touching the tributaries of the great river, the bays,
harbors, forests, and scenery along the shore, as well as the animals and birds with which
the islands and borders of the river were swarming at that period. It contains a discriminating
account of the character and habits of the savages as he saw them.<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>

<p>In 1613 Champlain published a second volume, embracing the events which had
occurred from 1603 to that date. The following is its title: <i>Les Voyages dv Sievr de Champlain
Xaintongeois, Capitaine ordinaire pour le Roy, en la marine, divisez en devx
livres; ou, jovrnal tres-fidele des observations faites és descouuertures de la Nouuelle

Berjon, rue S. Jean de Beauuais, au Cheual volant, et en sa boutique au Palais, à la

of the coast-line westerly from Canseau, including Nova Scotia, the Bay of Fundy,
New Brunswick, and New England as far as the Vineyard Sound. It deals not only with
the natural history, the fauna and flora, but with the character of the soil, its numerous
products, as well as the sinuosities and conformation of the shore, and is unusually minute
in details touching the natives. In this last respect it is especially valuable, as at that
period neither their manners, customs, nor mode of life had been modified by intercourse
with Europeans. The volume is illustrated by twenty-two local maps and drawings, and a
large map representing the territory which he had personally surveyed, and concerning
which he had obtained information from the natives and from other sources. This is the
first map to delineate the coast-line of New England with approximate correctness. The
volume contains likewise what he calls a “geographical map,” constructed with the degrees
of latitude and longitude numerically indicated. In this respect it is, of course, inexact,
as the instruments then in use were very imperfect, and it is doubtful whether his
surveys had been sufficiently extensive to furnish the proper and adequate data for
these complicated calculations. It was the first attempt to lay down the latitude and
longitude on any map of the coast.<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1619 Champlain published a third work, describing the events from 1615 to that
date. It was reissued in 1620 and in 1627. The following is its title, as given in the
issue of 1627:<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> <i>Voyages et Descovvertvres faites en la Novvelle France, depuis l’année

au Palais, en la gallerie des Prisonniers, M.D.C. XXVII. Avec privilege dv Roy.</i>
The previous issue contained the occurrences of 1613. The year 1614 he passed in
France. The present volume continues his observations in New France from his return
in 1615. It describes his introduction of the Recollect Fathers as missionaries to the
Indians, his exploration of the Ottawa, Lake Nipissing, Lake Huron, and Ontario; the
attack on the Iroquois fort in the State of New York; his winter among the Hurons;
and it contains his incomparable essay on the Hurons and other neighboring tribes. It
has Brûlé’s narrative of his experiences among the savages on the southern borders of the
State of New York, near the Pennsylvania line, and that of the events which occurred in
the settlement at Quebec; it contains illustrations of the dress of the savages in their
wars and feasts, of their monuments for the dead, their funeral processions, of the famous
fort of the Iroquois in the State of New York, and of the deer-trap.</p>

<p>In 1632 Champlain published his last work, under the following title: <i>Les Voyages de
la Novvelle France occidentale, dicte Canada, faits par le S<sup>r</sup> de Champlain Xainctongeois,

works, which we have omitted as unnecessary for our present purpose. This volume is
divided into two parts. The first part is an abridgment of what had already been published
up to this date, and omits much that is valuable in the preceding publications. It
preserves the general outline and narrative, but drops many personal details and descriptions
which are of great historical importance, and can be supplied only by reference to
his earlier publications. The second part is a continuation of his journals from 1620 to
1631 inclusive. Champlain’s personal explorations were completed in 1615-1616, and
consequently this second part relates mostly to affairs transacted at Quebec and on the
River St. Lawrence. It contains an ample and authentic account of the taking of Quebec
by the English in 1629. The volume is supplemented by Champlain’s treatise on navigation,
a brief work on Christian doctrine translated into the language of the Montagnais
by Brebeuf, and the Lord’s Prayer, Apostles’ Creed, etc., rendered into the same language
by Masse.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Reprints.</span>&mdash;In 1830 the first reprint of any of Champlain’s works was made at Paris,

<p class="pc1 mid">ACADIA.</p>

<p class="pc1">BY CHARLES C. SMITH,</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct"><i>Treasurer of the Massachusetts Historical Society.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap16">ACADIA is the designation of a territory of uncertain and disputed
extent. Though its sovereignty passed more than once from France
to England, and from England to France, its limits were never exactly defined.
But in this chapter it will be used to denote that part of America
claimed by Great Britain under the Treaty of Utrecht, in 1713, as bounded
on the south by the Atlantic Ocean, on the west by a line drawn due north
from the mouth of the Penobscot River, on the north by the River St.
Lawrence, and on the east by the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the Strait of
Canso. Within these bounds were minor divisions vaguely designated by
French or Indian names; and the larger part of this region was also called
by the English Nova Scotia, or New Scotland.</p>

        <p class="pf200">[This follows a copy of a water-color drawing
in the <i>Massachusetts Archives; Documents
Collected in France</i>, i. 441, called a portrait of
De Monts from an original at Versailles. Mr.
Parkman tells me that he was misled by this
reference of Mr. Poore in stating that a portrait
of De Monts existed at Versailles (<i>Pioneers</i>,
p. 222); since a later examination has not
revealed such a canvas, and the picture may
be considered as displaying the costume of the
gentleman of the period, if there is doubt concerning
its connection with De Monts. There
is another engraving of it in Drake’s <i>Nooks and
Corners of the New England Coast</i>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p>So large a tract of country
naturally presents great varieties of soil and climate and of other physical
characteristics; but for the most part it is fertile, and it abounds in mineral
resources, the extent and value of which were long unsuspected even by
such eager seekers for mines as the early voyagers. It was often the
theatre of sanguinary conflicts on a small scale, and its early history, which
is closely connected with that of the New England colonies, includes more
than one episode of tragic interest. Yet it has never filled an important
place in the history of civilization in America, and it was a mere make-weight
in adjusting the balance of losses and acquisitions by the two great
European powers which for a century and a half contended here for colonial
supremacy.</p>

<p>Acadia seems to have been known to the French very soon after the
voyages of Cabot, and to have been visited occasionally by Breton fishermen
almost from the beginning of the sixteenth century. For nearly
a hundred years these adventurous toilers of the sea prosecuted their
dangerous calling on the Banks of Newfoundland and the near shores
before any effective attempt at colonization was made. It was not until
1540 that a Picard gentleman, Jean François de Roberval, was appointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
viceroy of Canada, and attempted to establish a colony within the St. Lawrence.<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></p>

<p>Owing to the unexpected severity of the climate and the want of
support from France, the enterprise failed, and, with the exception of the
abortive efforts of De la Roche in 1584
and in 1598,<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> no new attempt at French
colonization was made for more than
half a century afterward, when the accession
of Henry IV. gave a new impulse
to the latent spirit of adventure. In 1603
Pierre de Guast, Sieur de Monts, was
named lieutenant-general of Acadia, with
powers extending over all the inhabitable
shores of America north of the latitude
of Philadelphia.<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> Vast as was this
domain, his real authority was confined
to very narrow limits. Setting sail from
France in the early part of April, 1604,
De Monts, accompanied by Champlain,
came in sight of Sable Island on the 1st
of May, and a week later made the mainland
at Cape La Hêve.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400">ISLE DE SAINTE CROIX.</p>
        <p class="pf400">[This is a fac-simile of Champlain’s engraving in his edition of 1613. The key is as follows: <i>A</i>, Habitation. <i>B</i>, Gardens. <i>C</i>, Isles with

<p>Subsequently
he doubled the southwestern point of the
peninsula of Nova Scotia, and coasting
along the shore of what is now known as
the Bay of Fundy, he finally determined to effect a settlement on a little
island<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> just within the mouth of the St. Croix River. Here several small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
buildings were erected, and the little company of seventy-nine in all prepared
to pass the winter. Before spring nearly one half of their number
died; and in the following summer, after the arrival of a small reinforcement,
it was decided to abandon the place. The coast was carefully explored
as far south as Cape Cod, but without finding any spot which
satisfied their fastidious tastes;<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> and the settlement was then transferred
to the other side of the bay, to what is now called Annapolis Basin, but
which De Monts had designated the year before as Port Royal. Here a
portion of the company was left to pass a second winter, while De Monts
returned to France, to prevent, if possible, the withdrawal of any part of
the monopoly granted him by the Crown.</p>

<p>Nearly a year elapsed before he again reached his settlement,&mdash;only to
find it reduced to two individuals. After a winter of great suffering, Pontgravé,
who had been left in command during the absence of De Monts,
weary with waiting for succor, had determined to sail for France, leaving
these two brave men to guard the buildings and other property. He had
but just sailed when Jean de Poutrincourt, the lieutenant of De Monts,
arrived with the long-expected help. Measures were immediately taken to
recall Pontgravé, if he could be found on the coast, and these were fortunately
successful. He was discovered at Cape Sable, and at once returned;
but soon afterward he sailed again for France.<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> Another winter was passed
at Port Royal, pleasantly enough according to the accounts of Champlain
and Lescarbot; but in the early summer, orders to abandon the settlement
were received from De Monts, whose monopoly of the trade with the
Indians had been rescinded. The settlers reluctantly left their new home,
and the greater part of them reached St. Malo, in Brittany, in October,
1607. The first attempt at French colonization in Acadia was as abortive
as Popham’s English colony at the mouth of the Sagadahock in the following
year.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></p>

<p>Three years later, Poutrincourt, to whom De Monts had granted Port
Royal, set sail from Dieppe to found a new colony on the site of the abandoned
settlement. The deserted houses were again occupied, and a brighter
future seemed to await the new enterprise. But this expectation was
doomed to a speedy disappointment.</p>

<p>After a few years of struggling
existence, the English colonists determined to expel the French as intruders
on the territory belonging to them. In 1613 an English ship,
under the command of Captain Samuel Argall, appeared off Mount Desert,
where a little company of the French, under the patronage of the Comtesse
de Guercheville,<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> had established themselves for the conversion of the

<p>The French were too few to offer even a show of resistance, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
the landing of the English was not disputed. By an unworthy trick, and
without the knowledge of the French, Argall obtained possession of the
royal commission; and then, dismissing half of his prisoners to seek in
an open boat for succor from any fishing vessel of their own country they
might chance to meet, he carried the others with him to Virginia. The
same year Argall was sent back by the governor of Virginia, Sir Thomas
Dale, to finish the work of expelling the French. With three vessels
he visited successively Mount Desert and St. Croix, where he destroyed
the French buildings, and then, crossing to Port Royal, seized whatever
he could carry away, killed the cattle, and burned the houses to the
ground. Having done this, he sailed for Virginia, leaving the colonists
to support themselves as they best could. Port Royal was not, however,
abandoned by them, and it continued to drag out a precarious existence.
Seventy-five years later, its entire population did not exceed six hundred,
and in the whole peninsula there were not more than nine hundred
inhabitants.<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, in 1621, Sir William Alexander, a Scotchman of some literary
pretensions, had obtained from King James a charter (dated Sept. 10,
1621) for the lordship and barony of New Scotland, comprising the territory
now known as the provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.
Under this grant he made several unsuccessful attempts at colonization;
and in 1625 he undertook to infuse
fresh life into his enterprise
by parcelling out the territory
into baronetcies.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> Nothing came
of the scheme, and by the treaty
of St. Germains, in 1632, Great Britain surrendered to France all the
places occupied by the English within these limits. Two years before
this, however, Alexander’s rights in a part of the territory had been purchased
by Claude and Charles de la Tour;<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> and shortly after the peace,
the Chevalier Razilly was appointed by Louis XIII. governor of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
whole of Acadia.<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> He designated as his lieutenants Charles de la Tour for
the portion east of the St. Croix, and Charles de Menou, Sieur d’Aulnay-Charnisé,
for the portion west of that river.</p>

<p>The former established himself
on the River St. John where the
city of St. John now stands, and the
latter at Castine, on the eastern shore
of Penobscot Bay. Shortly after his appointment,
La Tour attacked and drove away a small party of
Plymouth men who had set up a trading-post at Machias; and in 1635
D’Aulnay treated another party of the Plymouth colonists in a similar
way.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a></p>

<p>Subsequently the two
French commanders quarrelled, and, engaging in active hostilities, made
efforts (not altogether unsuccessful) to enlist Massachusetts in their quarrel.
For this purpose La Tour visited Boston in person in the summer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>

belonging to his rival. In the following year La Tour made a second
visit to Boston for further help; but he was able only to procure the
writing of threatening letters from the Massachusetts authorities to D’Aulnay.
Not long after La Tour’s departure from Boston, envoys from
D’Aulnay arrived here; and after considerable delay a treaty was signed
pledging the colonists to neutrality, which was ratified by the Commissioners
of the United Colonies in the following year; but it was not
until two years later that it was ratified by new envoys from the crafty

<p>In this interval D’Aulnay captured by assault La Tour’s fort at St. John,
securing booty to a large amount; and a few weeks afterward Madame la
Tour, who seems to have been of a not less warlike turn than her husband,
and who had bravely defended the fort, died of shame and mortification.
La Tour was reduced to the last extremities; but he finally made good his
losses, and in 1653 he married the widow of his rival, who had died two or
three years before.<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a></p>

<p>In 1654, in accordance with secret instructions from Cromwell, the whole
of Acadia was subjugated by an English force from Boston under the command
of Major Robert
Sedgwick, of Charlestown,
and Captain John Leverett,
of Boston. To the
latter the temporary government
of the country was intrusted. Ineffectual
complaints of this aggression were made to
the British Government; but by the treaty of
Westminster in the following year England was
left in possession, and the question of title was referred to commissioners.
In 1656 it was made a province by Cromwell, who appointed Sir Thomas
Temple governor, and granted the whole territory to Temple and to one
William Crown and Stephen de la Tour, son of the late governor. The
rights of the latter were purchased by the other two proprietors, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Acadia remained in possession of the English until the treaty of Breda,
in 1667, when it was ceded to France with undefined limits.<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a></p>

<p>Very little was done by
the French to settle and improve
the country; and on
the breaking out of war between
France and England
after the accession of William
III., it was again conquered
by an expedition fitted out
at Boston under Sir William
Phips. He sailed from Boston
on the 28th of April,
1690, with a frigate of forty
guns, two sloops, one of sixteen
guns and the other of
eight guns, and with four
smaller vessels; and after reducing
St. John, Port Royal,
and other French settlements,
and appointing an English
governor, he returned, with a
booty sufficient, it was thought,
to defray the whole cost of
the expedition.<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a></p>

<p>This result
was a signal triumph for the
New England colonies, and
when Phips became, in 1692,
the first royal governor of Massachusetts under the provincial charter,
Acadia was made a part of the domain included in it. At a later day
it was with no little indignation and mortification that New England saw
the conquered territory relinquished to the French by the Treaty of Ryswick,
in 1697; but the story of the later period belongs to a subsequent
volume.</p>

<p>Acadia had been the home of civilized men for nearly a hundred years;
but there was almost nothing to show as the fruits of this long occupation
of a virgin soil. It had produced no men of marked character, and its
history was little more than the record of feuds between petty chiefs, and of
feeble resistance to the attacks of more powerful neighbors. Madame la
Tour alone exhibits the courage and energy naturally to be looked for
under the circumstances in which three generations of settlers were placed.
At the end of a century there were only a few scattered settlements spread
along the coast, passing tranquilly from allegiance to one European sovereign
to allegiance to another of different speech and religion. A few
hundred miles away, another colony founded sixteen years after the first
venture of De Monts, and with scarcely a larger number of settlers, waged
a successful war with sickness, poverty, and neglect, and made a slow and
steady progress, until, with its own consent, it was united with a still more
prosperous colony founded twenty-three years after the first settlement at
Port Royal. There are few more suggestive contrasts than that which the
history of Acadia presents when set side by side with the history of Plymouth
and Massachusetts; and what is true of its early is not less true of
its later history.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE original authorities for the early history of the French settlements in Acadia<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a>
are the contemporaneous narratives of Samuel de Champlain and Marc Lescarbot.
Though Champlain comes within our observation as a companion of De Monts, a separate
chapter in this volume is given to his personal history and his writings.</p>


<p>Of the personal history of Marc Lescarbot we know much less than of that of Champlain.
He was born at Vervins, probably between 1580 and 1590, and was a lawyer in
Paris, where he had an extensive practice, and was the author of several works; only
one, or rather a part of one, concerns our present inquiry.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a></p>

<p>This was an account of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
settlement of De Monts in Acadia, which was translated into English by a Protestant
clergyman named Pierre Erondelle, and which gives a very vivid picture of the life at Port<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Royal.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> He appears to have been a man of more than ordinary ability, with not a little
of the French vivacity, and altogether well suited to be a pioneer in Western civilization.
His narrative covers only a brief period, and after the failure of the colony under De
Monts, he ceased to have any relations with Acadia. He is supposed to have died about
1630.</p>

<p>The advent of the Jesuits in 1611 introduces the <i>Relations</i> of their order as a source
of the first importance; but a detailed account of these documents belongs to another
chapter.<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> From the first of the series, by Father Biard, and from his letters in Carayon’s
<i>Première Mission des Jésuites au Canada</i>, a collection published in Paris in 1864, and
drawn from the archives of the Order at Rome, we have the sufferers’ side of the story
of Argall’s incursion; while from the English marauder’s letters, published in Purchas,
vol. iv., we get the other side.<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a></p>

<p>Another of these early adventurers who has left a personal account of his long-continued
but fruitless attempts at American colonization is Nicolas Denys, a native of
Tours. So early as 1632 he was appointed by the French king governor of the territory
between Cape Canso and Cape Rosier. Forty years later, when he must have been well
advanced in life, though he had lost none of his early enthusiasm, he published an historical
and geographical description of this part of North America.<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> The work shows that
he was a careful and observant navigator; but in its historical part it is confused and
perplexing. The second volume is largely devoted to an account of the cod-fishery,
and treats generally of the
natural history of the
places with which he was
familiar, and of the manners
and life of the Indians.
It has a different
titlepage from the first
volume.</p>

<p>Abundant details as to
the quarrels of D’Aulnay
and La Tour are in Winthrop’s
<i>History of New
England</i>; and many of
the original documents,
most of them in contemporaneous
translations,
are in the seventh volume
of the third series of the
<i>Collections</i> of the Massachusetts
Historical Society.
From the first of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
these sources Hutchinson, in his <i>History of Massachusetts Bay</i>, drew largely, as did Williamson
in his <i>History of Maine</i>, both of whom devoted considerable space to Acadian
affairs. For some of the later transactions Hutchinson is an original authority of unimpeachable
weight.<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> The Massachusetts writers are also naturally the sources of most of
our information regarding the expedition of 1654, though Denys and Charlevoix touch
upon it, and the modern historians of Nova Scotia treat it in an episodical way. The
articles of capitulation of Port Royal are in <i>Massachusetts Archives; Documents Collected
in France</i>, ii. 107.</p>

<p>Among the later French writers the pre-eminence belongs to the Jesuit Father, Pierre
François Xavier de Charlevoix, who had access to contemporaneous materials, of which
he made careful use; and his statements have great weight, though he wrote many years
after the events he describes. His <i>Histoire de la Nouvelle France</i> follows the course of
the French throughout the continent, and scattered through it are many notices of the
course of events in Acadia, but its more particular characterization belongs to another
chapter.</p>

<p>The papers drawn up by the French and English commissioners to determine the intent
of the treaty of Utrecht have a controversial purpose, and on each side are colored
and distorted to make out a case. In them are many statements of facts which need
only to be disentangled from the arguments by which they are obscured to have a high
value. No one, indeed, can have a thorough and accurate knowledge of Acadian history
who does not make constant reference to these memorials and to the justificatory pieces
cited on the one side or the other. They stand, when properly sifted and weighed, among
the most important sources for tracing the history of the province.<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>The episode of Sir William Alexander and his futile schemes of colonization is treated
exhaustively by Mr. Slafter in a monograph on <i>Sir William Alexander and American
Colonization</i>, which reproduces all the original charters and other documents bearing on
his inquiry, and apparently leaves nothing for any future gleaner in that field.<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> But, like
many other persons who have conducted similar investigations, it must be conceded that
Mr. Slafter attaches more importance to Sir William Alexander’s somewhat visionary
plans than they really merit. They were ill adapted to promote the great object of western
colonization, and they left no permanent trace behind them.</p>

<p>Whipple’s brief account of Nova Scotia in his <i>Geographical View of the District of
Maine</i> should not be overlooked; but it was written at a time when historical students
were less exacting than they now are, and its details are meagre and unsatisfactory.<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p>

<p>Haliburton’s <i>History of Nova Scotia</i> is a work of conscientious and faithful labor, but
in its preparation the author was under serious disadvantages from his inability to consult
many of the books on which such a history must be based; and as he was not able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
correct the proofs, his volumes are disfigured by the grossest typographical blunders. No
one without some previous familiarity with the subject can safely read it; but such a
reader will find in it much of value.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></p>

</div></div>

<p>A work of far higher authority, much fuller on the earlier periods, and one which is
generally marked by great thoroughness and accuracy, is Murdoch’s <i>History of Nova
Scotia</i>. Written in the form of annals, it lacks every grace of style; and in a few instances
the author has overlooked important sources of information,&mdash;such as Winthrop’s <i>History
of New England</i>,<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> which is not named in his list of authorities (p. 533), and which he
seems to have known only at second-hand through the citations of Hutchinson and of Ferland;
and the original papers connected with La Tour and D’Aulnay in the <i>Collections</i> of
the Massachusetts Historical Society. On the other hand, he had access for the first time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
to very valuable manuscript materials, which greatly enlarge our knowledge on not a few
points previously obscure.<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Cours d’Histoire du Canada</i> of the Abbé Ferland is mainly devoted to what is
now known as Canada; but there are several chapters in it on Acadian affairs. By birth
and choice a Canadian, “and above all a Catholic,” as he himself avows, his statements
and inferences need to be scrutinized carefully. He had, however, gathered considerable
new material, his narrative is clearly and compactly written, and his work must rank among
the best of the modern compilations.<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>The same, or nearly the same, may be said of Garneau’s <i>Histoire du Canada</i>. The
chapters on Acadia are based on materials easily accessible, and they add no new facts to
those given by the earlier writers; but his narrative is clear and exact, and not much
colored by the writer’s point of view. He had not, however, so firm a grasp of his subject
as had Ferland; and for the period covered by this inquiry the latter may be read with
much greater pleasure and profit.<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a></p>

<p>An English translation of Garneau’s work was published some years after its first appearance,
with omissions and alterations by the translator, who regarded the subject from
an entirely different point of view, and who did not hesitate to modify occasionally the
statements of the author, besides adding a great body of valuable notes.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a></p>

<p>Another recent work which may be profitably consulted on the early history of Acadia
is Henry Kirke’s <i>First English Conquest of Canada</i>.<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> This work deals mainly with the
lives of Sir David Kirke and his brothers, and its chief value is biographical; but it comprises
some hitherto unpublished documents from the Record Office, and throws considerable
light on obscure portions of the early history of Canada and Acadia.</p>

<p>Among these more recent writers the highest place belongs to Francis Parkman. In
his <i>Pioneers of France in the New World</i><a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> he has given an account of the first settlement
of the French in Acadia which is not less accurate in its minutest details than it is picturesque
in style and comprehensive in its grasp of the subject. Mr. Parkman needed only
a story of wider relations and more continuous influence to secure for his book a foremost
place among American histories. In his <i>Frontenac</i><a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> he has told with equal vividness the
story of the marauding warfare which devastated the coast of Acadia and the contiguous
English settlements from 1689 to 1697. No one of our historians has been more unwearied
in research, as no one has been more skilful in handling his materials. Based in
great part on original manuscripts from the French archives and on contemporaneous
narratives, his volumes leave nothing to be desired for the period which they cover.</p>

<h3><a name="c159" id="c159">EDITORIAL NOTES.</a></h3>

<p><b>A.</b> A Commissioner of Public Records of
Nova Scotia was appointed in 1857, and by his
list, printed in 1864, it appears that but one of
the two hundred and four volumes in which the
archives were arranged had papers of a date
earlier than 1700, and that this volume contained
copies of copies from the archives in Paris made
for the Canadian Government, and covered the
years 1632-1699. The Library of Parliament
<i>Catalogue</i>, p. 1538, shows that vol. i. of the third
series of manuscripts (1654-1699) is devoted to
Acadia. A Nova Scotia Historical Society, instituted
a few years ago, has as yet published
but one volume of Reports and Collections for
1878, but it contains contributions to a later
period in the history of Acadia than that now
under consideration.</p>


<p class="p1"><b>B.</b> <span class="smcap">The War in Maine and Acadia.</span>&mdash;The
revolution which deposed Andros in Boston
was also the occasion of withdrawing the garrisons
from the English posts toward Acadia;
and this invited in turn the
onsets of the enemy. It was
calculated in 1690 that there
were between Boston and
Canso four thousand two hundred
and ten Indians,&mdash;a
census destined to be diminished,
indeed, so that in 1726
the savages were only rated
for the same territory at five
hundred and six (<i>N. E. Hist.
and Geneal. Reg.</i>, 1866, p. 9).
But this diminution meant a
process of appalling war. In
the spring of 1689 came the
catastrophe at Choceco (now
Dover). Belknap, in his <i>New
Hampshire</i>, gives a sufficient
narrative; and Dr. Quint, in
his notes to Pike’s Journal
(<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, xiv.
124), indicates the manuscript
sources. For the capture of
the stockade at Pemaquid, which quickly followed,
we have the French side in the <i>Relation</i>
of Father Thury, the priest of the mission to the
Penobscot Indians, who was in the action, and
La Motte-Cadillac’s <i>Mémoire sur l’Acadie</i>, 1692.
Cf. the references in Shea’s <i>Charlevoix</i>, iv. 42.
The English side can be gathered from Mather’s
<i>Magnalia; Andros Tracts</i>, vol. iii.; 3 <i>Mass.
Hist. Coll.</i> vol. i.; Hough’s “Pemaquid Papers,”
in <i>Maine Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, vol. v.; Hubbard’s
<i>Indian Wars</i>, and John Gyles’s <i>Memoirs</i>, Boston,
1736 (see <i>Mem. Hist. Boston</i>, ii. 336). The
story, more or less colored, under new lights or
local associations, is told in Hutchinson’s <i>Massachusetts</i>,
Thornton’s <i>Ancient Pemaquid</i>, Johnston’s
<i>Bristol, Bremen, and Pemaquid</i> (p. 170),
and of course in Williamson and Parkman.</p>

<p>The <i>Relation</i> of Monseignat (<i>N. Y. Col. Doc.</i>,
vol. ix.) and La Potherie are the chief French accounts
on the surprise at Salmon Falls, in March,
1690, and according to Parkman, “Charlevoix
adds various embellishments not to be found in
the original sources.” On the English side, it is
still Mather’s <i>Magnalia</i> upon which we must
depend, and, as a secondary authority, upon Belknap’s
<i>New Hampshire</i> and Williamson’s <i>Maine</i>.
Parkman points out the help which sundry papers
in the <i>Massachusetts Archives</i> afford; and
Dr. Quint, in his notes to Pike’s Journal (<i>Mass.
Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, xiv. 125), has indicated other
similar sources.</p>

<p>The attack on Fort Loyal (Portland), in May,
1690, is studied likewise from Monseignat, La
Potherie, Mather, with some fresh light out of
the “Declaration” of Sylvanus Davis, in 3 <i>Mass.
Hist. Coll.</i>, i. 101, and Bradstreet’s letter to Governor
Leisler, in <i>Doc. Hist. N. Y.</i>, ii. 259. Le
Clercq gives the French view; cf. Shea’s <i>Charlevoix</i>,
iv. 133, and <i>Le Clercq</i>, ii. 295; Willis’s <i>Portland</i>,
p. 284, and <i>N. Y. Col. Doc.</i>, ix. 472.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Phips had sailed from Boston in
April to attack Port Royal. He anchored before
its defences on the 10th of May. The
place was quickly surrendered to Phips, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
11th of May, by De Meneval, its governor, who
did not escape the imputation of treachery at
the time. Parkman (<i>Frontenac</i>, pp. 237,) and
Shea (<i>Charlevoix</i>, iv. 155) give the authorities.
Parkman says Charlevoix’s own narrative is erroneous;
but on the French side we still have
Monseignat and Potherie, though both are
brief; the <i>Relation de la prise du Port Royal
par les Anglois de Baston</i>, May 27, 1690; the
official <i>Lettre au Ministre</i> of Meneval, and the
<i>Rapport de Champigny</i>, of October, 1690. Cf.
<i>N. Y. Col. Doc.</i>, iii. 720; ix. 474, 475.</p>

<p>On the English side we have Governor Bradstreet’s
instructions to Phips and an invoice of the
plunder, in the <i>Mass. Archives; a Journal of the
Expedition from Boston to Port Royal</i>, among
George Chalmers’ papers in the Sparks Manuscripts
at Harvard College, perhaps the document
referred to by Hutchinson, in speaking of
Phips, as “his Journal;” the unhistoric overflow
of Cotton Mather’s <i>Life of Phips</i>, and sundry
extracts embodied in Bowen’s <i>Life of Phips</i>.
Murdoch, in his <i>Nova Scotia</i>, ch. xxii., gives a
summarized account.</p>

<p>During Phips’s ill-starred expedition to Quebec
in the autumn of the same year, Colonel
Benjamin Church was ineffectually employed in
creating diversions in Phips’s favor in this lower
region. See Dr. Henry M. Dexter’s edition of
Church’s <i>History of the Expedition to the East</i>,
and additional letters of Church in Drake’s additions
to Baylies’ <i>Old Colony</i>, pt. v.; and in 4
<i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>, v. 271. Williamson (<i>Maine</i>, i.
624) summarizes the authorities.</p>

<p>Two years later the rapine began afresh.
York in Maine was captured and burned in 1692
by the Abenakis, one of whose chiefs gave to
Champigny the narrative which he sent to the
Minister, Oct. 5, 1692, which Parkman calls the
best French account. The Indians also gave
Villebon the exaggerated story which he gives
in his <i>Journal de ce qui s’est passé à l’Acadie</i>,
1691-1692. On the English side, we have the
account in Mather’s <i>Magnalia</i>, and the later
summaries of Williamson and of the general
historians.</p>

<p>In June, Portneuf and St. Castin, with their
savage followers, left Pentagöet to attack the
frontier post of Wells, but they
were foiled, and retreated. Villebon
is here the principal French
authority; and on the English
side, to the more general accounts
of Mather, Hutchinson, Williamson,
and to the eclectic summary of Niles’s
<i>Indian and French Wars</i>, we must add the local
historian Bourne’s <i>History of Wells</i>.</p>

<p>The reader can best follow Parkman (<i>Frontenac</i>,
p. 357, etc.), who carefully notes the
authorities for the way in which Frontenac was
foiled in 1693 in an attempt to capture the English
post at Pemaquid; and for the attack on
Oyster River the next year (1694), Parkman’s
references may be collated with Shea’s (<i>Charlevoix</i>,
iv. 256). The expedition was under the
conduct of Villieu and the Jesuit Thury, and
what was then known as Oyster River is now
Durham, about twenty miles from Portsmouth.
Villieu’s own Journal is preserved: <i>Relation du
Voyage fait par le Sieur de Villieu ... pour faire
la Guerre aux Anglois au printemps de l’an 1694</i>,
and Parkman says Champigny, Frontenac, and
Callières in their reports adopt Villieu’s statements.
Belknap’s <i>New Hampshire</i> has the best
English account, which may be supplemented by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
various papers in the <i>Provincial Records of New
Hampshire</i>, and the Journal of Pike in <i>Mass.
Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, xiv. 128, with Dr. Quint’s notes.
The <i>Mass. Archives</i> have depositions and letters.</p>

<p>In 1696 Iberville, in charge of two war-ships
which had come from France, uniting with such
forces and savage allies as Villebon, Villieu, St.
Castin, and Thury could gather, appeared on
the 14th of August before the English fort at
Pemaquid, which quickly surrendered. Pemaquid
is a peninsula on the Maine coast between
the mouths of the Kennebec and Penobscot, and
the fort was situated as shown in the accompanying
sketch. It was the most easterly of the
English posts in this debatable territory, as the
French fort at Biguyduce (Pentagöet or Castine)
was the most westerly of the enemy’s. The fort
at Pemaquid had been rebuilt of stone by Phips
in 1692. (Mather’s <i>Magnalia</i>, Johnston’s <i>Bristol
and Bremen</i>.) Baudoin, an Acadian priest, accompanied
the expedition, and wrote a <i>Journal
d’une voyage fait avec M. d’Iberville</i>, and Parkman
also cites as contemporary French authorities
the <i>Relation de ce qui s’est passé</i>, etc., of
1695-1696, and Des Goutin’s letter to the
Minister of Sept. 23, 1696; cf. <i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>,
vol. ix.</p>

<p>Mather and Hutchinson are still the chief
writers on the English side, while everything of
local interest is gathered in Johnston’s<i> History
of Bristol and Bremen, in Maine, including
Pemaquid</i>, Albany, 1873.</p>

<p>The immediate result of the capture of Pemaquid
was to release D’Iberville for an attempt
to drive the English from the
east coast of Newfoundland in
1697. Parkman tells the story
in his <i>Frontenac</i>, p. 391, and by
him and by Shea in his <i>Charlevoix</i>,
v. 46, the original sources are traced.</p>

<p>Mr. Parkman (<i>Frontenac</i>, p. 408) has an important
note on the military insufficiency of the
English colonies at this time.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>C.</b> <span class="smcap">Threatened French Attacks upon
Boston.</span>&mdash;Ever after the surrender of the region
east of the Penobscot to the French in
1670, there were recurrent hopes of the French
to make reprisals on the English by an attack
on Boston, and emissaries of the French occasionally
reported upon the condition of that
town. Grandfontaine, on being empowered to
receive the posts of Acadia from the English
(<i>Massachusetts Archives: Documents Collected in
France</i>, ii. 209, 211), had been instructed, March
5, 1670, to make Pentagöet his seat of government;
and it was at Boston, July 7, 1670, that
he and Temple concluded terms of peace; and
we have (Ibid., ii. 227) a statement of the condition
of the fort at Pentagöet when it was
turned over. Talon (Ibid., ii. 247) shortly after
informed the King of his intention to go to
Acadia (Nov. 2, 1671), hoping for a conference
with Temple, whom he reports as disgusted with
the government at Boston, “which is more republican
than monarchical;” and the Minister,
in response, June 4, 1672 (Ibid., ii. 265), intimates
that it might do to give naturalization papers
and other favors to Temple, if he could be induced
to come over to the French side. In 1678
new hopes were entertained, and under date of
March 21, we find (Ibid., ii. 359) the French had
procured a description of Boston and its shipping.
Frontenac and Duchesneau were each
representing to the Court the disadvantages
Canada was under in relation to the trade of
the eastern Indians, with Boston offering such
rivalry (Ibid., ii. 363; iii. 12); and Duchesneau,
Nov. 14, 1679, enlarges upon a description of
Boston and its defenceless condition (Ibid., ii.
371). When the English made peace with the
Abenakis in 1681, Frontenac reported it to the
Court, with his grievances at the aggressions of
the Boston people, to whom he had sent De la
Vallière to demand redress (Ibid., iii. 29, 31);
and to end the matter, Duchesneau, Nov. 13,
1681, proposed to the Minister the purchase of
the English colonies. “It is true,” he says,
“that Boston, which is an English town, does
not acknowledge the sovereignty of the Duke of
York at all, and very little the authority of the
English King” (Ibid., iii. 35). The French
meanwhile had assumed a right to Pemaquid,
and Governor Dongan of New York had ordered
them to withdraw (Ibid., iii. 81), while
complications with the “Bastonnais” increased
rapidly (Ibid., iii. 49). De Grosellier sent to the
Minister new accounts of the Puritan town and
its situation (Ibid., iii. 450); and the Bishop of
Quebec remonstrated with the King for his permitting
Huguenots to settle in Acadie, since they
held communication with the people of Boston,
and increased the danger (Ibid., iii. 95). The
King in turn addressed himself rather to demanding
of the Duke of York that he should
see the English at Boston did not aid the savages
of Acadia. In 1690 more active measures
were proposed. On the day before Phips
anchored at Port Royal, a “Projet” was drawn
up at Versailles for an attack on Boston, in
which its defenceless state was described:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“La costé de Baston est peuplée, mais il n’y à
aucun poste qui veille. Baston mesme est sans palissades
à moins qu’on n’en ait mis depuis six mois. Il
y a bien du peuple en cette colonie, mais assez difficile
à rassembler. Monsieur Perrot connoist cette coste, et
le Sieur de Villebon qui est à la Rochelle à present,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
avec le nommé La Motte,&mdash;tous le trois ont souvent
esté à Baston et à Manat.... Par la carte suivante,
on peut voir comme ce pays se trouve situé,” etc.</p>

<p class="p1">The capture of Pemaquid in 1696 revived
hopes in the French of making a successful
descent upon Boston, and even upon New
York.</p>

<p>Several documents in reference to the scheme,
and respecting in part Franquelin’s map of Boston,
are in the <i>Mass. Archives; Documents Collected
in France</i>, iv. 467, etc. This map is given
in the <i>Memorial History of Boston</i>, vol. ii. p. li,
from a copy made by Mr. Poore, and in Mr.
Parkman’s manuscript collections. In the same
place will be found accounts of earlier French
maps of Boston (1692-1693), one of them by
Franquelin, but both very inexact. The references
on this projected inroad of the French are
given by Parkman (<i>Frontenac</i>, p. 384), Shea
(<i>Charlevoix</i>, v. 70), and Barry (<i>Massachusetts</i>,
ii. 89, etc.).</p>

<p class="drop-cap06">PURCHAS in his <i>Pilgrimage</i> quaintly writes, that “the great river
Canada hath, like an insatiable merchant, engrossed all these water
commodities, so that other streames are in a manner but meere pedlers.”<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a></p>

<p>This river of Canada, the Hochelaga of the natives, now known as the
St. Lawrence, is the most wonderful of all the streams of North America
which find their way into the Atlantic Ocean. Its extreme headwaters are
on the elevated plateau of the continent, near the birthplace of the Mississippi,
which flows into the Gulf of Mexico, and the Red River of the North,
which empties into Hudson’s Bay. Expanding into the interior sea, Lake
Superior, after rippling and foaming over the rocks at Sault Ste. Marie
it divides into Lake Michigan and Lake Huron; and passing through the
latter and Lake St. Claire<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> and Lake Erie, with the energy of an infuriated
Titan it dashes itself into foam and mist at Niagara. After recovering
composure, it becomes Ontario, the “beautiful lake,”<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> and then, hedged
in by scenery varied, sublime, and picturesque, and winding through a
thousand isles, it becomes the wide and noble river which admits vessels
of large burden to the wharves of the cities of Montreal and Quebec;
and until lost in the Atlantic, “many islands are before it, offering their
good-nature to be mediators between this haughty stream and the angry
ocean.”<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> The aborigines, who dwelt in rude lodges near its banks, chiefly
belonged to the Huron or Algonquin family; and although there were
variations in dialect, they found no difficulty in understanding one another,
and in their light canoes they made long journeys, on which they
exchanged the copper implements and agate arrow-heads of the far West
for the shells and commodities of the sea-shore.<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a></p>

<p>Cartier, born at the time that the discoveries of Columbus were being
discussed throughout Europe, who had toughened into a daring navigator,
sailed in 1535 up the St. Lawrence, giving the river its present name, and
on the 2d of October he reached the site now occupied by the city of Montreal.
Escorted by wondering and excited savages, he went to the top
of the hill behind the Indian village, and listened to descriptions of the
country from whence they obtained <i>caignetdaze</i>, or red copper, which was
reached by the River Utawas, which then glittered like a silver thread amid
the scarlet leaves of the autumnal forest.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> The explorations of the French
and English in the western world led the merchants of both countries to
seek for its furs, and to hope for a shorter passage through it to “the
wealth of Ormus and of Ind.” Apsley, a London dealer in beads, playing-cards,
and gewgaws in the days of Queen Elizabeth, wrote that he expected
to live long enough to see a letter in three months carried to China by
a route that would be discovered across the American continent, between
the forty-third and forty-sixth parallel of north latitude.<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> The explorations
of Champlain have been sketched in an earlier chapter.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> To the
incentive of the fur-trade a new impulse was added when, in the spring
of 1609, some Algonquins visited the trading-post, and one of the chiefs
brought from his sack a piece of copper a foot in length, a fine and pure
specimen. He said that it came from the banks of a tributary of a great
lake, and that it was their custom to melt the copper lumps which they
found, and roll them into sheets with stones.</p>

<p>It was in 1611, when returning from one of his visits to France, where
he had become betrothed to a twelve-year-old maiden, Helen, the daughter
of a Huguenot, Nicholas Boullé, secretary of the King’s Chamber, that
Champlain pushed forward his western occupation by establishing a frontier
trading-post where now is the city of Montreal, and arranging for trade
with the distant Hurons, who were assembled at Sault St. Louis.</p>

<p>Again in 1615, as we have seen, he extended his observations to Lake
Huron, while on his expedition against the Iroquois. With the Hurons he
passed the following winter, and visited neighboring tribes, but in the spring
of 1616 returned to Quebec; and although nearly twenty years elapsed
before his remains were placed in a grave in that city, he appears to have
been contented as the discoverer of Lakes Champlain, Huron, and Ontario,
and relinquished farther westward exploration to his subordinates.</p>

<p>The fur-trade of Canada produced a class of men hardy, agile, fearless,
and in habits approximating to the savage.<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> Inured to toil, the <i>voyageurs</i>
arose in the morning, “when it was yet dark,” and pushing their birch-bark
canoes into the water, swiftly glided away, “like the shade of a cloud on the
prairie,” and often did not break fast until the sun had been for hours above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the horizon. Halting for a short period, they partook of their coarse fare,
then re-embarking they pursued their voyage to the land of the beaver and
buffalo, the woods echoing their <i>chansons</i> until the “shades of night began
to fall,” when,</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Worn with the long day’s march and the chase of the deer and the bison,<br />
Stretched themselves on the ground, and slept where the quivering firelight<br />
Flashed on their swarthy cheeks, and their forms wrapped up in their blankets.”</p>

<p class="p1">Among the pioneers of these wanderers in the American forests was
Étienne (Anglicized, Stephen) Brulé, of Champigny.<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> It has been mentioned
that he went with Champlain to the Huron villages near Georgian
Bay, but did not with his Superior cross Lake Ontario. After three years
of roaming, he came back to Montreal, and told Champlain that he had
found a river which he descended until it flowed into a sea,&mdash;the river by
some supposed to be the Susquehanna, and the sea Chesapeake Bay.<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a>
While in this declaration he may have depended upon his imagination,
yet to him belongs the undisputed honor of being the first white man
to give the world a knowledge of the region beyond Lake Huron.</p>

<p>Sagard<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> mentions that this bold <i>voyageur</i>, with a Frenchman named
Grenolle, made a long journey, and returned with a “lingot” of red copper
and with a description of Lake Superior which defined it as very large,
requiring nine days to reach its upper extremity, and discharging itself
into Lake Huron by a fall, first called Saut de Gaston, afterward Sault Ste.
Marie. Upon the surrender of Quebec, in 1629, to the English, Étienne
Brulé chose to cast in his lot with the conquerors.<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> During the occupation
of nearly three years the English heard many stories of the region of the
Great Lakes, and they encouraged the aborigines of the Hudson and Susquehanna
to purchase English wares.</p>

<p>The very year that the English occupied Quebec, Ferdinando Gorges
and associates, who had employed men to search for a great lake, received
a patent for the province of Laconia, and the governor thereof
arrived in June, 1630, in the ship “Warwick,” at Piscataway, New Hampshire.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a>
Early in June, 1632, Captain Henry Fleet, in the “Warwick,”
visited the Anacostans, whose village stood on the shores of the Potomac
where now is seen the lofty dome of the Capitol of the Republic. These
Indians told Fleet that they traded with the Canada Indians; and on the
27th of the month, at the Great Falls of the Potomac, he saw two axes
of the pattern brought over by the brothers Kyrcke to Quebec.<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></p>

<p>About the time Quebec was restored to the French, on the 23d of September,
1633,<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> Captain Thomas Young received a commission from the King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
of England to make certain explorations in America.<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> The next spring he
sailed, and among his officers was a “cosmographer, skilful in mines and
trying of metals.” Entering Delaware Bay on the 24th of July, 1634, he
sailed up the river, which he named Charles, in honor of the King, and
by the 1st of September had reached the vicinity of the falls, above
Trenton, the capital of New Jersey. In a report from this river, dated
the 20th of October, he writes: “I passed up this great river, with purpose
to have pursued the discovery thereof till I had found the great lake<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a>
from which the great river issues, and from thence I have particular reason
to believe there doth also issue some branches, one or more, by which I
might have passed into that Mediterranean Sea which the Indian relateth
to be four days’ journey beyond the mountains; but having passed near
fifty leagues up the river, I was stopped from further proceedings by a
ledge of rocks which crosseth the river.”</p>

<p>He then expresses a determination the next summer to build a vessel
above the falls, from whence he hoped to find “a way that leadeth
into that mediterranean sea,” and from the lake. He continues: “I judge
that it cannot be less than one hundred and fifty or two hundred leagues
in length to our North Ocean; and from thence I purpose to discover
the mouths thereof, which discharge both into the North and South
Sea.”<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> The same month that Captain Young was exploring the Valley
of the Delaware, an expedition left Quebec which was not so barren
of results.</p>

<p>The year that Étienne Brulé came back from his wandering in the far
West, in 1618, Jean Nicolet, the son of poor parents at Cherbourg, came
from France, and entered the service of the fur company known as the
“Hundred Associates,” under Champlain. For several years he lived
among the Algonquins of the Ottawa Valley, and traded with the Hurons;
and because of his knowledge of the language of these people, he was
valued as an interpreter by the trading company. On the 4th day of July,
1634, on his eventful journey to distant nations, he was at Three Rivers, a
trading post just begun. Threading his way in a frail canoe among the
isles which extend from Georgian Bay to the extremity of Lake Huron,
he, through the Straits of Mackinaw, discovered Lake Michigan, and turning
southward found its Grand Bay, an inlet of the western shore, and
impressive by its length and vastness.</p>

<p>Here were the Gens de Mer,<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> or Ochunkgraw, called by the Algonquins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Ouinipegous or Ouinipegouek,&mdash;people of the salt or bad-smelling
water; and the traders gave them the name of Puants.</p>

<p>Calling a council of these Winnebagoes and the neighboring tribes, and
knowing the power of display upon the savage, he appeared before them in
a grand robe of the damask of China, on which was worked flowers and
birds of different colors, and holding a pistol in each hand,&mdash;a somewhat
amusing reminder of the Jove of mythology, with his variegated mantle
and thunderbolts. To many he seemed a messenger from the spirit-land;
and the women and children, on account of his pistols, called him the man
who bore thunder in his hands.<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a></p>

<p>Nicolet announced that he was a peacemaker, and that he desired that
they should settle their quarrels and be on friendly terms with the French
at Quebec. His words were well received, and one chief, at the conclusion
of the conference, invited him to a feast, at which one hundred and
twenty beaver were served. He came back to Three Rivers during the
next summer, and renewed the interest in the discovery of a route to the
Western Ocean, by the declaration that if he had paddled three days more
on a large river (probably the Wisconsin), he would have found the sea.
There was no design to deceive; but the great water at that distance was
what has been called “the father of waters,” the Mississippi. Before December,
1635, he was appointed interpreter at the new trading-post of Three
Rivers, and was there when, on Christmas Day, at the age of sixty-eight
years, one who had been the life of the fur-trade and the Governor of New
France, Samuel de Champlain, expired at Quebec. After the death of the
fearless and enterprising Champlain, there was a lull in the zest for discovery,
and then difficulties arose which for a time led to the abandonment of
all the French trading-posts on the shores of Lake Huron and Lake
Michigan.</p>

<p>The Iroquois had for years longed to be revenged upon those who, with
the aid of French arquebuses, had defeated them in battle. Friendly relations
were established between them and the Dutch traders on the banks of
the Hudson River; and for beaver skins, powder and firearms were received.
With these they gratified their desire for revenge. They became a terror
to the savage and civilized in Canada; and traders and missionaries, women
and infants, fled from their scalping-knives.</p>

<p>The following graphic description of affairs was penned in 1653:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The war with the Iroquois has dried up all sources of prosperity. The beaver
are allowed to build their dams in peace, none being able or willing to molest them.
Crowds of Hurons no longer descend from their country with furs for trading. The
Algonquin country is depopulated, and the nations beyond it are retiring farther away,
fearing the musketry of the Iroquois. The keeper of the Company’s store here in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Montreal has not bought a single beaver-skin for a year. At Three Rivers, the small
means in hand have been used in fortifying the place, from fear of an inroad upon it.
In the Quebec storehouse all is emptiness.”</p>

<p class="p1">At length, in the year 1654, peace was effected between the French
and Iroquois, and traders again appeared on the upper lakes, and Indians
from thence appeared at Montreal. In August, two Frenchmen accompanied
some Ottawas to the region of the upper lakes; and in the latter
part of August, 1656, these traders came back to Quebec with a party
of Ottawas,<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> whose canoes were loaded with peltries; and about this time
a trader told a Jesuit missionary that “he had seen three thousand men
together, for the purpose of making a treaty of peace, in the country of
the Gens de Mer.”</p>

<p>In 1659, while the new governor Argenson was experiencing the perplexities
of administration at Quebec, the extremity of Lake Superior was
reached by two energetic and intelligent traders,&mdash;Medard
Chouart, known in history as Sieur des Groseilliers,
and Pierre d’Esprit or Sieur Radisson. Chouart was born
a few miles east of Meaux, and left France when he was about sixteen years
of age, and became a trader among the Hurons. In 1647 he married the
widow Étienne, of Quebec, the father of whom was the pilot Abraham Martin,
whose baptismal name was given to the suburb of that city, the Plains
of Abraham. She gave birth to a son in 1651, named after his father, and
soon after died. Chouart, the Sieur des Groseilliers, then married Marguérite
Hayet Radisson, and through her he became a sympathizer with
the Huguenots.<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> His brother-in-law, Sieur Radisson, was born at St. Malo,
France, and in 1656 married at Three Rivers, Canada, Elizabeth Herault;
and after her death he espoused a daughter of the zealous Protestant, Sir
David Kyrcke, to whose brothers Champlain had surrendered Quebec.</p>

<p>Pushing beyond Lake Superior, after travelling six days in a southwesterly
direction, these traders found the Tionnotantés, a band incorporated
with the Hurons, called by the French Petuns, because they had
raised tobacco. These people dwelt in the country between the sources
of the Black and Chippeway Rivers in Wisconsin, where they had been
wanderers for several years. Driven from their homes by the Iroquois,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
they migrated with the Ottawas to the isles of Lake Michigan, at the
entrance of Green Bay. Hearing that the Iroquois had learned where
they had retreated, they descended the Wisconsin River until they found
the Mississippi, and, ascending this twelve leagues, they came to the
Ayoes (Ioway) River, now known as the Upper Iowa, and followed it
to its source, being kindly treated by the tribes. Although buffaloes
were in abundance, they were disappointed when they found no forests,
and retracing their steps to the Mississippi, ascended to a prairie
island above Lake Pepin, about nine miles below the mouth of the River
St. Croix, and here they often received friendly visits from the Sioux.
Confident through the possession of firearms, the Ottawas and Hurons
conspired to drive the Sioux away, and occupy their country. The attack
was unsuccessful, and they were forced to look for another residence.
Going down the Mississippi, they entered one of the mouths of the
Black River, near the modern city La Crosse, and the Hurons established
themselves about its sources, while their allies, the Ottawas, continued their
journey to Lake Superior, and stopped at a point jutting out like a bone
needle,&mdash;hence called Chagouamikon.</p>

<p>Groseilliers and Radisson, while sojourning with the Hurons, learned
much of the deep, wide, and beautiful river, comparable in its grandeur
to the St. Lawrence,<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> on an isle of which they had for a time resided.
Proceeding northward, these explorers wintered with the Nadouechiouec,
who hunted and fished among the “Mille Lacs” of Minnesota, between
the St. Croix and Mississippi Rivers. The Sioux, as these people were
called by traders, were found to speak a language different from the Huron
and Algonquin, and to have many strange customs. Women, for instance,
were seen whose noses had been cut off as a penalty for adultery, giving
them a ghastly look. Beyond, upon the northwest shore of Lake Superior,
about the Grand Portage, and at the mouth of a river which upon early
maps was called Groseilliers, there was met a separated warlike band of
Sioux, called Poualak, who, as wood was scarce in the prairie region, made
fire with coal (<i>charbon de terre</i>), and lived in skin lodges, although some of
the more industrious built cabins of mud (<i>terre grasse</i>), as the swallows
build their nests. The Assinepoualacs, or Assineboines, were feared by the
Upper, as the Iroquois were dreaded by the Lower, Algonquins.</p>

<p>After an absence of about a year, these traders, about the 19th of
August, 1660, returned to Montreal with three hundred Indians and sixty
canoes laden with a “wealth of skins,”&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Furs of bison and of beaver,<br />
Furs of sable and of ermine.”</p>

<p class="p1">The settlers there, and at Three Rivers, and at Quebec, were deeply
interested by the tales of the vastness and richness of the new-found land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
and the peculiarities of the wild Sioux. As soon as the furs were sold
and a new outfit obtained, Groseilliers, on the 28th of August, again took
his way to the westward, accompanied by six Frenchmen, besides the
aged Jesuit missionary René Menard and his servant Guérin.</p>

<p>Just beyond the Huron Isles and Huron Bay, which still retain their
name, on the southern shore of Lake Superior, is Keweenaw Bay; and on
the 15th of October, Saint Theresa’s Day in the calendar of the Church
of Rome, the traders and René Menard, with the returning Indians,
stopped, and here some traders and the missionary passed the winter
among the Outaouaks.<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> Father Menard, discouraged by the indifference
of these Indians, resolved to go to the retreat of the Hurons among the
marshes of what is now the State of Wisconsin. He sent three Frenchmen
who had been engaged in the fur-trade to inform them of his intention;
but after journeying for some days they were appalled by the bogs,
rapids, and long portages, and returned. Undaunted by their tale of the
difficulties of the way, and some Hurons having come to visit the Outaouaks,
he resolved to return with them. On the 13th of June, 1661, Menard
and his servant, Jean Guérin, by trade a gunsmith, followed in the
footsteps of their Indian guides, who, however, soon forsook them in the
wilderness. For fifteen days they remained by a lake, and finding a
small canoe in the bushes, they embarked with their packs; and week
after week in midsummer, annoyed by myriads of mosquitoes, and suffering
from heat, hunger, and bruised feet, they advanced toward their destination,
and about the 7th of August, while Guérin was making a portage
around a rapid in a river, Menard lost the trail. His servant, becoming
anxious, called for him, yet there was no answer; and then he five times
fired his gun, in the hope of directing him to the right path, but it was
of no avail. Two days after, Guérin reached the Huron village, and endeavored
without success to employ some of the tribe to go in search of
the aged missionary.</p>

<p>Afterward Guérin met a Sauk Indian with Menard’s kettle, which he said
he found in the woods, near footprints going in the direction of the Sioux
country.<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> His breviary and cassock were said to have been found among
the Sioux, and it is supposed that he was either killed, or died from exposure,
and that his effects were taken by wandering Indians.<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> Perrot writes:
“The Father followed the Ottawas to the Lake of the Illinois [Michigan],
and in their flight to Louisiana [Mississippi] as far as the upper part of
Black River.” Upon a map prepared by Franquelin, in 1688,<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> for Louis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
XIV., there is a route marked by a dotted line from the vicinity of
Keweenaw Bay to the upper part of Green Bay. If Perrot’s statement
is correct, Menard and his devoted attendant Guérin saw the Mississippi
twelve years before Joliet and his companion looked upon the great river.
The reports of Nicolet and Groseilliers led to a correction and enlargement
of the charts of New France. On a map<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> accompanying the <i>Historia
Canadensis</i>, by Creuxius, Lake Michigan is marked as “Magnus Lacus
Algonquinorum, seu Lacus Fœtetium,” and a lake intended for Nepigon
is called “Assineboines,” near which appear the nations Kilistinus and
Alimibegôecus. The lake of the Assineboines is connected by a river
with an arm of Hudson’s Bay called “Kilistonum Sinus;” and west of this
is Jametus Sinus, or James’s Bay.</p>

<p>Pierre Boucher, an estimable man, sent by the inhabitants of Canada to
present their grievances to the King of France, in a little book which in 1663
he published at Paris,<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> wrote: “In Lake Superior there is a great island
which is fifty leagues in circumference, in which there is a very beautiful
mine of copper.” He also stated that he had heard of other mines from
five Frenchmen lately returned, who had been absent three years, and that
they had seen an ingot of copper which they thought weighed more than
eight hundred pounds, and that Indians after making a fire thereon would
cut off pieces with their axes.</p>

<p>Groseilliers<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> returned to Canada, and on the 2d of May, 1662, again
left Quebec, with ten men, for the North Sea, or Hudson’s Bay. His
journey satisfied him that it was easy to secure the trade of the North by
way of Lake Superior; but the Company of Canada, which had the
monopoly of the fur traffic, looked upon Groseilliers’ plans for securing
the peltries of distant tribes as chimerical. Thus disappointed and chagrined,
Groseilliers next went to Boston, and presented his schemes to its
merchants.</p>

<p>The Reverend Mother of the Incarnation, Superior of the Ursulines
at Quebec, in allusion to him, wrote: “As he had not been successful in
making a fortune, he was seized with a fancy to go to New England to
better his condition. He excited a hope among the English that he had
found a passage to the Sea of the North.” Passing from Boston to
France, and securing the influence of the English ambassador at Paris,
he went to London, and became acquainted with Prince Rupert, nephew
of Charles I., who led the cavalry charge against Fairfax and Cromwell
at Naseby. This brilliant man was now devoted to study and to the
exhibition of the philosophical toy known to chemists as “Rupert’s
drops;” but he was ready to indorse the project for extending the
fur-trade, and seeking a northwestern passage to Asia. Men of science
also showed interest in explorations which would enlarge the sphere of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
knowledge. The Secretary of the Royal Society wrote a too sanguine
letter to Robert Boyle, the distinguished philosopher, and friend of the
apostle Eliot. His words were: “Surely I need not tell you, from hence,
what is said here with great joy of the discovery of a northwest passage,
and by two Englishmen and one Frenchman, lately represented by them to
his Majesty at Oxford, and answered by the grant of a vessel to sail into
Hudson’s Bay and channel into the South Sea.” The ship “Nonsuch”
was fitted out in charge of Captain Zachary Gillam, a son of one of the
early settlers of Boston, and in this vessel Groseilliers and Radisson left
the Thames in June, 1668, and the next September reached a tributary
of Hudson’s Bay, which in honor of their chief patron was called Rupert’s
River. The next year, by way of Boston, they returned to England, where
their success was applauded; and in 1670 the trading company was chartered,&mdash;still
in existence, and among the most venerable of English corporations,&mdash;known
as “The Hudson’s Bay Company.”</p>

<p>While the Canadian Fur Company did not respond to the proposals
of Groseilliers for the extension of commerce, the French Government, in
view of the fact that the Dutch on the south side of the St. Lawrence and
in the valley of the Hudson River had acknowledged
allegiance to England, determined to show more interest
in the administration of Canadian affairs, and
Mézy having been recalled, hardly before his death,
Daniel de Remi, Seigneur de Courcelles, was
sent as provincial governor. They also created
the new office of Intendant of Justice, Police,
and Finance, and made Talon&mdash;a person of talent,
experience, and great energy&mdash;the first incumbent.
Arriving at Quebec in 1665, Talon took decided steps for the
promotion of agriculture, tanneries, and fisheries, and was enthusiastic
in the desire to see the white banner of France, with its fleur-de-lis,
floating in the far West.<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a></p>

<p>In the autumn of 1668 he took with him to France one of the hardy <i>voyageurs</i>
who had lived in the region of the lakes, and on the 24th of the next
February he writes to Colbert, the Colonial Minister, that this man “had
penetrated among the western nations farther than any other Frenchman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
and had seen the copper mine on Lake Huron. The man offers to go to
that mine and explore, either by sea, or by the lake and river, the communication
supposed to exist between Canada and the South Sea, or to the
region of Hudson’s Bay.”</p>

<p>During the summer of 1669 the active and intelligent Louis Joliet, with
an outfit of four hundred livres, and one Peré, perhaps the same person who
gave his name to a river leading from Lake Nepigon to Hudson’s Bay,<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a>
with an outfit of one thousand livres, went to search for copper on the
shores of Lake Superior, and to discover a more direct route from the
upper lakes to Montreal. Joliet went as far as Sault Ste. Marie, where he
did not long remain; but in the place of a mine found an Iroquois prisoner
among the Ottawas at that point, and obtained permission to take him back
to Canada. In company with another Frenchman, he was led by the Iroquois
from Lake Erie through the valley of the Grand River to Lake Ontario,
and on the 24th of September, at an Iroquois village between this river and
the head of Burlington Bay, he met La Salle with four canoes and fifteen
men, and the Sulpitian priests, Galinée and De Casson, who on the 6th of
July had left the post at La Chine.</p>

<p>La Salle, alleging ill health, at this point separated from the missionaries,
and Joliet, before proceeding toward Montreal, drew a chart of the upper
lakes for the guidance of the Sulpitians. By the aid of this the priests
reached Lake Erie through a direct river, and near the lake they erected
a hut and passed the winter. On the 23d of March, 1670, they resumed
their voyage, and on the 25th of May reached Sault Ste. Marie, where there
were about twenty-five Frenchmen trading with the Indians. Here was
also the mission of the Jesuits among the Ottawas,&mdash;a square enclosure
defended by cedar pickets twelve feet high, and within were a small house
and chapel which had recently been built. Remaining but three days, they
returned to Montreal by the old route along the French River of Lake
Huron to Lake Nipissing, and thence by portage to the Ottawa River.</p>

<p>About the time of their arrival Talon had learned from some Algonquins
that two European vessels had been seen in Hudson’s Bay, and he
wrote to Colbert,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq p1">“After reflecting on all the nations that might have penetrated as far north as that,
I can fall back only on the English, who under the conduct of one named Desgrozeliers,
in former times an inhabitant of Canada, might possibly have attempted that
navigation, of itself not much known, and not less dangerous. I design to send by
land some men of resolution to invite the Kilistinons, who are in great numbers in the
vicinity of that bay, to come down to see us as the Ottawas do, in order that we
may have the first handling of what the latter savages bring us, who, acting as retail
dealers between us and those natives, make us pay for the roundabout way of three
or four hundred leagues.”</p>

<p class="p1">To draw the trade from the English, it was determined to make an alliance
of friendship with all the nations around Lake Superior. One of
the Frenchmen<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> who roved among the tribes west of Lake Michigan,
and in the valley of the Fox River, was Nicholas Perrot. Accustomed
from boyhood to the scenes and excitements of frontier life, quick-witted,
with some education, a leading spirit among <i>coureurs des bois</i>, and looked
upon with respect by the Indians, he was an intelligent explorer of the
interior of the continent. In the spring of 1670, when twenty-six years
of age, Perrot left Green Bay with a flotilla of canoes filled with peltries
and paddled by Indians. By way of Lake Nipissing he reached the
Ottawa River, and descended to Montreal, and in July he visited Quebec.
By the Intendant Talon he was invited to act as guide and interpreter to
his deputy, Simon François Daumont, the Sieur Saint Lusson, who on the
3d of September was commissioned to go to Lake Superior to search for
copper mines and confer with the tribes.</p>

<p>It was not until October that Perrot and Saint Lusson left Montreal.
When Manitoulin Island in Lake Huron was reached, it was decided that
Saint Lusson should here remain for the winter hunting and trading, while
Perrot went on and visited the tribes of the Green Bay region. On the 5th
of May, 1671, he met Saint Lusson at Sault Ste. Marie, accompanied by the
principal chiefs of the Sauks, Menomonees, Pottawattamies, and Winnebagoes.
After the delegates of fourteen tribes had arrived, a council was
held, on the 14th of June, by Saint Lusson, in the presence of the Jesuits
André, Claude Allouez, Gabriel Dreuilletes, and the head of the mission
Claude d’Ablon, Nicholas Perrot the interpreter, Louis Joliet, and some
fur-traders;<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> and a treaty of friendship was formed, and the countries
around Lakes Huron and Superior were taken possession of in the name
of Louis XIV., King of France. Talon announces the result of the expedition
in these words:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Sieur de Saint Lusson is returned, after having advanced as far as five hundred
leagues from here, and planted the cross and set up the King’s arms in presence of
seventeen Indian nations,<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> assembled on this occasion from all parts, all of whom
voluntarily submitted themselves to the dominion of his Majesty, whom alone they
regard as their sovereign protector. This was effected, according to the account of
the Jesuit Fathers, who assisted at the ceremony, with all the formality and display the
country could afford. I shall carry with me the record of taking possession prepared
by Sieur de Saint Lusson for securing those countries to his Majesty.</p>

<p class="pbq">“The place to which the said Sieur de Saint Lusson has penetrated is supposed to
be no more than three hundred leagues from the extremities of the countries bordering
on the Vermillion or South Sea. Those bordering on the West Sea appear to be
no farther from those discovered by the French. According to the calculation made
from the reports of the Indians and from maps, there seems to remain not more than
fifteen hundred leagues of navigation to Tartary, China, and Japan. Such discoveries
must be the work of either time or of the King. It can be said that the Spaniards
have hardly penetrated farther into the interior of South, than the French have done
up to the present time into the interior of North, America.</p>

<p class="pbq">“Sieur de Lusson’s voyage to discover the South Sea and the copper mine will not
cost the King anything. I make no account of it in my statements, because, having
made presents to the savages of the countries of which he took possession, he has
reciprocally received from them in beaver that which replaces his outlay.”</p>

<p class="p1">The Hurons and Ottawas did not arrive in time to witness the formal
taking possession of the country by the representative of France, having
been detained by difficulty with the Sioux. About the year 1662, the
Hurons, who had lingered about the sources of the Black River of Wisconsin,
joined again their old allies, the Ottawas, who were clustered at the end
of the beautiful Chegoimegon Bay of Lake Superior. The Ottawas lived in
one village, made up of three bands,&mdash;the Sinagos, Kenonché, and Kiskakon.
After this union, a party of Saulteurs, Ottawas, Nipissings, and Amikoués
were securing white-fish not far from Sault Ste. Marie, when they
discovered the smoke of an encampment of about one hundred Iroquois.
Cautiously approaching, they surprised and defeated their dreaded foes,
at a place to this day known as Iroquois Point, just above the entrance of
Lake Superior.</p>

<p>After this, the Hurons, Ottawas, and Saulteurs returned in triumph to
Keweenaw and Chegoimegon, and remained in quietness until a number of
Hurons went to hunt west of Lake Superior, and were captured by some
of the Sioux. While in captivity they were treated with kindness, asked to
come again, and sent away with presents. Accepting the invitation, the
Sinagos chief, with some warriors and four French traders, visited the Sioux,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
and were received with honor and cordiality. Again, a few Hurons went
into the Sioux country, and some of the young warriors made them prisoners;
but the Sioux chief, who had smoked the calumet with the Sinagos
chief, insisted upon their release, and journeyed to Chegoimegon Bay to
make an apology. Upon his arrival, the Hurons proved tricky, and persuaded
the Ottawas to put to death their visitor. It was not strange that
the Sioux were surprised and enraged when they received the intelligence,
and panted for revenge. Marquette, who had succeeded Allouez at the
mission which was between the Huron and Ottawa villages, in allusion to
this disturbance, wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Our Outaouacs and Hurons, of the Point of the Holy Ghost, had to the present
time kept up a kind of peace with them [the Sioux], but matters having become
embroiled during last winter, and some murders having been committed on both
sides, our savages had reason to apprehend that the storm would soon burst on them,
and they deemed it was safer for them to leave the place, which they did in the
spring.”</p>

<p class="p1">The Jesuits retired with the Hurons and Ottawas, and more than one
hundred and fifty years elapsed before another Christian mission was attempted
in this vicinity, under the “American Board of Foreign Missions.”
The retreating Ottawas did not halt until they reached an old hunting-ground,
the Manitoulin Island of Lake Huron, and the Hurons stopped at
Mackinaw. From time to time they formed war-parties with other tribes,
against the Sioux. In 1674 some Sioux warriors arrived at Sault Ste.
Marie to smoke the pipe of peace with adjacent tribes. At a grand council
the Sioux sent twelve delegates, and the others forty. During the conference
one of the opposite side drew near and brandished his knife in the face
of a Sioux, and called him a coward. The Sioux replied he was not afraid,
when the knife was plunged into his heart, and he died. A fight immediately
began, and the Sioux bravely defended themselves, although nine
were killed. The two survivors fled to the rude log chapel of the Jesuit
mission, and closed the door, and finding there some weapons they opened
fire upon their enemies. Their assailants wished to burn down the chapel,
which the Jesuits would not allow, as they had beaver skins stored in the
loft. In the extremity a lay brother of the mission, named Louis Le
Boeme, advised the firing of a cannon shot at the cabin’s door. The discharge
killed the last two of the Sioux.<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> Governor Frontenac made complaint
against Le Boeme for this conduct, in a letter to Colbert.<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></p>

<p>After the Iroquois had made a treaty of peace with the French, they did
not cease to lurk and watch for the Ottawas as they descended to trade at
Montreal, Three Rivers, or Quebec, and, as occasion offered, rob them of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
their peltries and tear their scalps from their heads. Governor Courcelles,
in 1671, determined to establish a post on Lake Ontario which would act
as a barrier between the
Ottawas and Iroquois,
and at the same time
draw off the trade from
the Hudson River.</p>

<p>Before
entering upon his journey he had constructed a large plank flat-boat
to ascend the streams,&mdash;a novelty which was a surprise. It was of two
or three tons burden, and provided with a strong rope to haul it over the
rapids and shoal places. On the morning of the 3d of June the expedition
left Montreal, consisting of the flat-boat, filled with supplies and manned
by a sergeant and eight soldiers, and thirteen bark canoes. The party
numbered fifty-six persons, who were active and willing to endure the
hardships of the journey. At night, with axe in hand, the men cut poles
for a lodge frame, which they covered with bark stripped from the trees.
The Governor, to protect himself from mosquitoes, had a little arbor made
on the ground, about two feet high, and covered with a sheet, which
touched the ground on all sides, and prevented the approach of the insects
which disturb sleep and irritate the flesh. The second day of the
voyage the flat-boat found difficulty in passing the first rapids, and Courcelles
plunged into the water, and with the aid of the hardy <i>voyageurs</i>
pushed the boat into smooth water. On the 10th of June the first flat-boat
reached the vicinity of Lake Ontario, and the Governor two days after, in
a canoe, reached the entrance of the lake. Here he found a stream with
sufficient water to float a large boat, and bordered by fine land, which
would serve as a site for a post. On the 14th, at the time that the deputy
Saint Lusson, at Sault Ste. Marie, was taking possession of the region of
Lake Superior, Courcelles was descending the rapids of the St. Lawrence
on his return to Montreal.<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The report of this expedition was sent to Louis XIV., and it met with his
approval; but for the benefit of his health Courcelles was permitted to
return to France, and on the 9th of April, 1672, Louis de Buade, Count de
Frontenac, was appointed Governor and Lieutenant-General in Canada and
other parts belonging to New France. It was not until the leaves began
to grow old that Frontenac arrived
in Quebec, and, full of
energy, was ready to push on
the work of exploration which
had been initiated by his predecessor. Upon the advice of the Intendant
Talon, he soon despatched Louis Joliet to go to the Grand River, which
the Indians alleged flowed southward to the sea. Joliet (often spelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Jolliet) was born in Canada, the son of a wagon-maker. In boyhood
he had been a promising scholar in the Jesuits’ school at Quebec, but,
imbibing the spirit of the times, while a young man he became a rover in
the wilderness and a trader among Indians. Three years before his appointment
to explore the great river beyond the lakes, he had been sent
with Peré to search for a copper-mine on Lake Superior, and the year
before he stood by the side of Saint Lusson as he planted the arms of
France at Sault Ste. Marie.</p>

<p>It was not until Dec. 8, 1672, that he reached the Straits of Mackinaw,
and as the rivers between that point and the Mississippi were by this
time frozen, he remained there during the winter and following spring,
busy in questioning the Indians who had seen the great river as to its
course, and as to the nations on its shores. On May 17, 1673, he began
his journey toward a distant sea. At Mackinaw he found Marquette, who
became his companion, but had no official connection with the expedition,
as erroneously mentioned by Charlevoix. With five <i>voyageurs</i> and two
birch-bark canoes, Joliet and Marquette, by the 7th of June, had reached a
settlement of Kikapous, Miamis, and Mascoutens, in the valley of the Fox
River, and three leagues beyond they found a short portage by which they
reached the Wisconsin River, and following its tortuous course amid sandbars
and islands dense with bushes, on the 17th of June they entered the
broad great river called the Mississippi, walled in by picturesque bluffs,
with lofty limestone escarpment, whose irregular outline looked like a succession
of the ruined castles and towers of the Rhine. In honor of his
patron, Governor Frontenac, Joliet called it Buade, the Governor’s family
name. Passing one great river flowing from the west, he learned that
through its valley there was a route to the Vermeille Sea [Gulf of California],
and he saw a village (which was about five days’ journey from another)
which traded with the people of California.<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a></p>

<p>This river is without name on his map,<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> but on its banks he places villages
of the Missouri, Kansa, Osages, and Pawnee tribes. The River Ohio
he marked with the Indian name Ouabouskigou; and the Arkansas, beyond
which he did not descend, and which was reached about the middle of July,
he named Bazire, after a prominent merchant of Quebec interested in the
fur-trade. After ascending the stream, he entered the Illinois River, which
he designated as the Divine, or Outrelaise, in compliment, it is supposed,
to Frontenac’s wife, a daughter of Lagrange Trianon, noted for her beauty,
and Mademoiselle Outrelaise, her fascinating friend, who were called in
Court circles “les divines.”<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> Upon the west bank of one of its tributaries,
the Des Plaine River, there stands above the prairie a remarkable elevation
of clay, sand, and gravel, a lonely monument which has withstood the
erosion of a former geologic age. It was a noted landmark to the Indians
in their hunting, and to the French <i>voyageurs</i> on their trading expeditions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
By this Joliet was impressed, and he gave the elevation his own name,
Mont Joliet, which it has retained, while all the others he marked on his
map have been forgotten.<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> It was not until about the middle of August,
1674, that he returned to Quebec, and Governor Frontenac, on the 14th
of November, writes to the French Government,&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Sieur Joliet, whom Monsieur Talon advised me, on my arrival from France, to
despatch for the discovery of the South Sea, returned three months ago, and found
some very fine countries, and a navigation so easy through the beautiful rivers, that a
person can go from Lake Ontario and Fort Frontenac in a bark to the Gulf of
Mexico, there being only one carrying place, half a league in length, where Lake
Ontario communicates with Lake Erie. A settlement could be made at this post, and
another bark built on Lake Erie.... He has been within ten days’ journey of the
Gulf of Mexico, and believes that water communication could be found leading to the
Vermillion and California Seas, by means of the river that flows from the west, with
the Grand River that he discovered, which rises from north to south, and is as large
as the St. Lawrence opposite Quebec.</p>

<p class="pbq">“I send you, by my secretary, the map<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> he has made of it, and the observations
he has been able to recollect, as he lost all his minutes and journals in the wreck
he suffered within sight of Montreal, where, after having completed a voyage of twelve
hundred leagues, he was near being drowned, and lost all his papers, and a little
Indian whom he brought from those countries.”</p>

<p class="p1">Governor Frontenac was satisfied with the importance of establishing a
post on Lake Ontario, as Courcelles had suggested, and in the summer of
1673 visited the region. On the 3d of June he departed from Quebec, and
at five o’clock in the afternoon of the 15th was received at Montreal amid
the roar of cannon and the discharge of musketry. On the 9th of July
he had reached a point supposed to be in the present town of Lisbon,
in St. Lawrence County, New York, at the head of all the rapids of the St.
Lawrence; and while sojourning there, at six o’clock in the evening two
Iroquois canoes arrived with letters from La Salle, who two months before
went into their country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>After exchanging civilities with the Iroquois, and guided by them, Frontenac
was led into a beautiful bay about a cannon-shot from the River
Katarakoui, which so pleased him as a site for a post, that he stayed until
sunset examining the situation. The next day his engineer, Sieur Raudin,
was ordered to trace out the plan of a fort, and on the morning of the 14th,
at daybreak, soldiers and officers with alacrity began to clear the ground,
and in four days the fort was finished, with the exception of the abatis.
After designating the garrison and workmen who were to remain at the
post, and making La Salle the commandant, on the 27th Frontenac began
his homeward voyage, about the time that Joliet began to ascend the
Mississippi from the mouth of the Arkansas.<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a></p>

<p>The reports of Joliet led to the formation of plans for the occupation of
the valley of the Mississippi by the leading merchants and officers of
Canada; and the application of Joliet, its first explorer, to go with twenty
persons and establish a post among the Illinois, was refused by the French
Government.<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a></p>

<p>Frontenac, in the fall of 1674,<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> sent La Salle to France. Under the date
of the 14th of November, he wrote to Minister Colbert that La Salle was a
man of character and intelligence, adapted to exploration, and asking him
to listen to his plans. A few weeks before La Salle’s arrival in Paris, the
Prince of Condé had fought a battle at Seneffe, and obtained a victory over
the Prince of Orange and the allied generals, and every one was full of the
praise of the King’s household guards, who without flinching remained eight
hours under the fire of the enemy. La Salle could hardly have thought at
that moment that the future was yet to reveal as his associates in the exploration
of the distant valley of the Mississippi a <i>gend’arme</i> of his Majesty’s
guard and a field chaplain of that bloody day.<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> In a memorial to the King,
he asked for the grant of Fort Frontenac and lands adjacent, agreeing to
repay Frontenac the money he had expended in establishing the post, to
repair it, and keep a garrison therein at his own expense. He further asked,
in consideration of the voyages he had made at his own expense during the
seven years of his residence in Canada, that he might receive letters of nobility.<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a>
The King, upon the report of Colbert, accepted the offer, and on the
13th of May, 1675, conferred upon La Salle the rank of esquire, with power
to attain all grades of knighthood and <i>gendarmerie</i>.<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> This year he came
back to Canada in the same ship with Louis Hennepin, and going to Fort
Frontenac in August, 1676, he increased the buildings, erected a strong wall
on the land side, and strengthened the palisades toward the water. From
time to time he had cattle brought thither from Montreal, and constructed
barks to navigate the lake, keep the Iroquois in check, and deter the English
from trading in the region of the upper lakes.<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> In November, 1677, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
made another visit to France,<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> and obtained a permit, dated the 12th of May,
1678, allowing him to explore the western part of New France, with the
prospect of penetrating as far as Mexico.<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> The expedition was to be at the
expense of himself and associates, with the privilege of trade in buffalo
skins, but with the express condition that he should not trade with the
Ottawas and other Indians who brought their beavers to Montreal.</p>

<p>Frontenac was not only in full sympathy with La Salle, but with other
enterprising adventurers, and there is but little doubt that he shared the
profits of the fur-traders. About the time that La Salle was improving
Fort Frontenac as a trading-post, Raudin,<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> the engineer who had laid out
the plan of that fort, was sent by Frontenac with presents to the Ojibways
and Sioux, at the extremity of Lake Superior.<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> A nephew of Patron,
named Daniel Greysolon du Lhut,<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> and who had made two voyages from
France before 1674, had then entered the army as squire of Marquis de
Lassay, was in the campaign of Franche-Comté and at Seneffe, having now
returned to Quebec was permitted to go on a voyage of discovery in the
then unknown region where dwelt the Sioux and Assineboines.</p>

<p>On the 1st of September, 1678, with three Indians and three Frenchmen,
Du Lhut left Montreal for Lake Superior, and wintered at some point on the
shore of, or in the vicinity of, Lake Huron. On the 5th of April, 1679, he
was in the woods, three leagues from Sault Ste. Marie, when he wrote in the
third person to Governor Frontenac: “He will not stir from the Nadoussioux
until further orders; and peace being concluded he will set up the
King’s arms, lest the English and other Europeans settled toward California
take possession of the country.”<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> On the 2d of July, 1679, Du Lhut planted
the arms of France beyond Lake Superior, among the Isanti Sioux,<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> who
dwelt at Mille Lacs, in what is now the State of Minnesota, and then visited
the Songaskitons (Sissetons) and Houetbatons, bands of the Sioux, whose
villages were one hundred and twenty leagues beyond. Entering by way of
the St. Louis River, it would be easy, by a slight portage, to reach the
Sioux village, which was at that time on the shores of the Sandy Lake of
the Upper Mississippi.</p>

<p>Among those who went to the Lake Superior region at the same time as
Du Lhut, were Dupuy, Lamonde, and Pierre Moreau, alias La Taupine, who
had been with Saint Lusson at the planting of the French arms in 1671 at
Sault Ste. Marie, and was trading among the Illinois when Joliet was in that
country. In the summer of 1679 La Taupine returned, and it was rumored
that he had obtained among the Ottawas in two days nine hundred beavers.
Duchesneau, Intendant of Justice, feeling that Moreau had violated the law
forbidding <i>coureurs des bois</i> to trade with the Indians, had him, in September,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
arrested at Quebec; but Moreau produced a license from Governor
Frontenac, permitting him, with his two comrades, to go to the Ottawas, to
execute his secret orders, and so was liberated. He had not left the prison
but a short time when an officer and some soldiers came with an order from
Frontenac to force the prison, in case he were still there. In a letter to
Seignelay he writes: “It is certain, my Lord, that the said La Taupine
carried goods to the Ottawas, that his two comrades remained in the
country, apparently near Du Lhut, and that he traded there.”<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a></p>

<p>On the 15th of September Du Lhut had returned to Lake Superior, and
at Camanistigoya, or the Three Rivers, the site of Fort William of the old
Northwest Company, he held a conference with the Assineboines, an alienated
band of the Sioux, and other northern tribes, and persuaded them to
be at peace, and to intermarry with the Sioux. The next winter he remained
in the region near the northern boundary of Minnesota; but in
June, 1680, he determined to visit the Issati Sioux by water, as he had before
gone to their villages by land.<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> With two canoes, an Indian as an interpreter,
and four Frenchmen,&mdash;one of whom was Faffart, who had been in
the employ of La Salle at Fort Frontenac,<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a>&mdash;he entered a river eight
leagues from the extremity of Lake Superior, now called Bois Brulé, a narrow,
rapid stream, then much obstructed by fallen trees and beaver-dams.
After reaching its upper waters a short portage was made to Upper Lake
St. Croix, the outlet of which was a river, which, descending, led him to the
Mississippi.</p>

<p>Two weeks after Du Lhut left Montreal to explore the extremity of Lake
Superior, La Salle returned from France, accompanied by the brave officer
Henry Tonty, who had lost one hand in battle, but who, with an iron substitute
for the lost member, could still be efficient in case of a conflict. He
also brought with him, beside thirty persons, a supply of cordage, anchors,
and other material to be used at Fort Frontenac and on his proposed journey
toward the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

</div>

<p>After reaching Frontenac, La Motte, who had been a captain in a
French regiment, was sent in advance, with the Franciscan Hennepin and
sixteen men, to select a site for building a vessel to
navigate the upper lakes. On the 8th of January,
1679, La Salle and Tonty, late at night, reached La
Motte’s encampment at the rapids below the Falls of
Niagara, only to
find him absent on
a visit to the Senecas.
The next day
La Salle climbed
the heights, and following the portage road round the cataract he found at
the entrance of Cayuga Creek an admirable place for a ship-yard. La
Motte having returned to his encampment, with La Salle and Tonty he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
visited the selected site, and Tonty was charged with the supervision of the
ship-builders.</p>

<p>Four days later, the keel of the projected vessel was laid, and in May it
was launched with appropriate ceremonies, and named after the fabulous
animal&mdash;the symbol of strength and swiftness,&mdash;the “Griffin,” two of
which were the supporters of the escutcheon of Count Frontenac. Tonty,
on the 22d of July, was sent forward with five men to join fourteen others
who had been ordered by La Salle to stop at the mouth of the Detroit
River. On the 7th day of August the “Griffin” spread her sails upon her
voyage to unknown waters whose depths had never been sounded, and early
on the morning of the 10th reached Tonty and his party, who had
anxiously awaited its coming, and received them on board. On the 10th
of August, the day in the calendar of the Church of Rome devoted to the
memory of the virgin Saint Clare, foundress of the Franciscan Order of
Poor Clares, the vessel entered the lake called by the Franciscan priests
after her, although now written St. Clair. On the 27th they reached the
harbor of Mackinaw,&mdash;a point on the mainland south of the straits; and
upon his landing La Salle was greatly surprised to find there a number of
those whom he had sent, at the close of the last year, to trade for his
benefit with the Illinois. Their excuse for their unfaithfulness was credence
in a report that La Salle was a visionary, and that his vessel would
never arrive at Mackinaw. Four of the deserters were arrested. La Salle,
learning that two more&mdash;Hemant and Roussel, or Roussellière&mdash;were at
Sault Ste. Marie, sent Tonty on the 29th with six men to take them into
custody. While the lieutenant was absent on this errand, La Salle lifted
his anchor and set sail for the Grand Bay, now Green Bay, where he found
among the Pottawattamies still others of those whom he had sent to the
Illinois, and who had collected furs to the value of twelve thousand livres.
From this point he determined to pursue his journey southward in a canoe,
and to send back the “Griffin” with the peltries here collected. On the
18th of September the ship&mdash;in charge of the pilot, a supercargo, and five
sailors&mdash;sailed for the magazine at the end of Lake Erie, but it never
came to Mackinaw. Some Indians said it had been wrecked, but there was
never any certain information obtained. A Pawnee lad, fourteen or fifteen
years of age, who was a prisoner among the Indians near a post established
among the Illinois, reported that the pilot of the “Griffin” had been
seen among the Missouri tribes, and that he had ascended the Mississippi,
with four others, in two canoes, with goods stolen from the ship, and
some hand-grenades. It was the intention of this party to join Du Lhut,
and if they could not find him, to push on to the English on Hudson’s
Bay. Meeting some hostile Indians, a fight occurred, and all the Frenchmen
were killed but the pilot and another, who were sold as prisoners to
the Missouri Indians. In the chapter on the exploration of the lakes, it
is only necessary to allude to that portion of La Salle’s expedition which
pertains to this region.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>After La Salle had established Fort Crèvecœur among the Illinois, on
the 29th of February, 1680, he sent Michel Accault (often spelt Ako) on
a trading and exploring expedition to the Upper Mississippi. He took
with him Anthony Augelle, called the Picard, and the Franciscan priest
Louis Hennepin, in a canoe, with goods valued at about a thousand livres.
In ascending the Mississippi the party was hindered by ice near the mouth
of the Illinois River until the 12th of March, when they resumed their
voyage. Following the windings of the Mississippi, La Salle mentions in
a letter written on the 22d of August, 1682, at Fort Frontenac,<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> that they
passed a tributary from the east called by the Sioux Meschetz Odéba,<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a>
now called Wisconsin, and twenty-three or twenty-four leagues above
they saw the Black River, called by the Sioux Chabadeba.<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> About the
11th of April, at three o’clock in the afternoon, a war-party of Sioux going
south was met, and Accault, as the leader, presented the calumet,<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> and
gave them some tobacco and twenty knives. The Sioux gave up their
expedition, and conducted Accault and his companions to their villages.
On the 22d of April the isles in the Mississippi were reached,
where two Sioux had been killed by the Maskoutens, and they stopped to
weep over their death, while Accault, to assuage their grief, gave them in
trade a box of goods and twenty-four hatchets. Arriving at an enlargement
of the river, about three miles below the modern city of St. Paul, the
canoes were hidden in the marshes, and the rest of the journey to the villages
of Mille Lacs was made by land. Six weeks after they reached the
villages, the Sioux determined to descend the Mississippi on a buffalo hunt,
and Hennepin and Augelle went with the party.</p>

<p>When Du Lhut reached the Mississippi from Lake Superior, he found
eight cabins of Sioux, and learned that some Frenchmen were with the party
hunting below the St. Croix River. Surprised by the intelligence, leaving
two Frenchmen to guard his goods, he descended in a canoe with his interpreter
and his other two men, and on the morning of the third day he
found the hunting camp and the Franciscan Hennepin. In a letter to
Seignelay, written while on a visit in France, Du Lhut writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“The want of respect which they showed to the said Reverend Father provoked
me, and this I showed them, telling them he was my brother. And I had him
placed in my canoe to come with me into the villages of the said Nadouecioux,
whither I took him; and a week after our arrival I caused a council to be convened,
exposing the ill treatment which they had been guilty of, both to the said Reverend
Father and to the other two Frenchmen who were with him, having robbed them and
carried them off as slaves,<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> and even taken the priestly vestments of said Reverend
Father.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“I had two calumets, which they had danced to, returned, on account of the insults
which they had offered, being what they hold most in esteem to appease matters,
telling them I did not take calumets from the people who, after they had seen me
and received my peace presents, and had been for a year always with Frenchmen,
robbed them when they went to visit them. Each one in the council endeavored
to throw the blame from himself, but their excuses did not prevent my telling the
Reverend Father Louis that he would have to come with me towards the Outagamys
[Foxes], as he did; showing him that it would strike a blow at the French nation,
in a new discovery, to suffer an insult of this nature without manifesting resentment,
although my design was to push on to the sea in a west-northwesterly direction,
which is that which is believed to be the Red Sea [Gulf of California], whence
the Indians who had gone to war on that side gave salt to three Frenchmen whom
I had sent exploring, and who brought me said salt, having reported to me that
the Indians had told them that it was only twenty days’ journey from where they
were to find the great lake, whose waters were worthless to drink. They had made
me believe that it would not be absolutely difficult to find it, if permission were given
to go there.</p>

<p>“However, I preferred to retrace my steps, exhibiting the just indignation I felt,
rather than to remain, after the violence which they had done to the Reverend Father
and the other two Frenchmen who were with him, whom I put in my canoes and
brought back to Michelimakinak.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">It was not until some time in May, 1681, that Du Lhut arrived at Montreal,
and although he protested that his journey had only been in the
interest of discovery and of peace-making with the tribes, the Intendant of
Justice accused him of violating the King’s edict against trading with the
Indians, and Frontenac held him for a time in the castle at Quebec, more as
a friend than as a prisoner. It was but a little while before an amnesty came
from the King of France to all suspected of being “<i>coureurs des Bois</i>,” and
authorizing Governor Frontenac to issue yearly twenty-five licenses to
twenty-five canoes, each having three men, to trade among the savages.</p>

<p>Duchesneau, the Intendant of Justice, still complained that the Governor
winked at illicit trade, and on the 13th of November, 1681, he wrote
to Seignelay, who had succeeded his father as Minister for the Colonies:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“But not content with the profits to be derived within the countries under the
King’s dominion, the desire of making money everywhere has led the Governor, Sieurs
Perrot, Boisseau, Du Lhut, and Patron, his uncle, to send canoes loaded with peltries
to the English. It is said that sixty thousand livres’ worth has been sent thither; and
though proof of this assertion cannot be adduced, it is a notorious report.... Trade
with the English is justified every day, and all those who have pursued it agree that
beaver carried to them sells for double what it does here, for that worth fifty-two sous,
six deniers, the pound, duty paid, brings eight livres there, and the beaver for Russia
sells there at ten livres the pound in goods.”</p>

<p class="p1">On grounds of public policy Frontenac in 1682 was recalled, and De la
Barre, his successor, in October of this year held a conference with the most
influential persons, among whom was Du Lhut, who afterward sailed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
France, and early in 1683<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> there wrote the letter to Seignelay from which
extracts have been made.</p>

<p>The Iroquois having found it profitable to carry the beavers of the
northwest to the English at Albany, determined to wage war against the
tribes of the upper Lakes, seize Mackinaw, and drive away the French.
Governor de la Barre, to thwart this scheme, in May, 1683, sent Oliver
Morrel, the Sieur de la Durantaye, with six canoes and thirty good men,
to Mackinaw, and the Chevalier de Baugy was ordered to the fort established
by La Salle on the Illinois River, in charge of Tonty. As soon as Durantaye
reached Mackinaw, he immediately sent parties to Green Bay to take
steps to humble the Pottawattamies for the hostility exhibited toward the
French. He afterward went down the west side of Lake Michigan, and
Chevalier de Baugy proceeded on the other side, hoping to meet La Salle,
who was expected to go to Mackinaw by following the eastern shore.</p>

<p>Du Lhut, upon his return from France, obtained a license to trade, and
in August arrived at Mackinaw with men and goods for trading in the Sioux
country<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> by way of Green Bay. Upon the 8th of the month he left Mackinaw
with about thirty persons; and after leaving their goods at the
extremity of the Bay, they proceeded, armed for war, to the village of the
Pottawattamies, and rebuked them for the bad feelings which they had
exhibited. Some Cayuga Iroquois in the vicinity captured five of the Wyandot
Hurons that Du Lhut had sent out to reconnoitre, but avoided the
French post. “The Sieur du Lhut,” writes the Governor to Seignelay,
“who had the honor to see you at Versailles, happening to be at that post
when my people arrived, placed himself at their head, and issued such good
orders that I do not think it can be seized, as he has employed his forces
and some Indians in fortifying and placing himself in a condition of determined
defence.” Having been advised of the retreat of the Iroquois, Du
Lhut proceeded toward the north to execute his design of stopping English
trade in that direction. The project is referred to in a despatch of the
Canadian to the Home Government in these words: “The English of
Hudson’s Bay have this year attracted many of our northern Indians, who
for this reason have not come to trade to Montreal. When they learned
by expresses sent them by Du Lhut, on his arrival at Messilimakinak, that
he was coming, they sent him word to come quickly, and they would
unite with him to prevent all others going thither any more. The English
of the Bay excite us against the savages, whom Sieur du Lhut alone
can quiet.”</p>

<p>Departing from his first post at Kaministigouia, the site of which is in
view of Prince Arthur’s Landing, he found his way between many isles, varied
and picturesque, to a river on the north shore of Lake Superior leading to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Lake Nepigon (Alepimigon). Passing to the northeastern extremity, he
built a post on a stream connecting with the waters of the Hudson’s Bay,
called after a family name, La Tourette. He returned the next year, if not
to Montreal, certainly to Mackinaw. Keweenaw by this time had become
a well-known resort of traders; and in its vicinity, in the summer of 1683, two
Frenchmen, Colin Berthot and Jacques Le Maire, had been surprised by
Indians, robbed and murdered. While Du Lhut was at Mackinaw, on the
24th of October, he was told that an accomplice, named Folle Avoine, had
arrived at Sault Ste. Marie with fifteen Ojibway families who had fled from
Chagouamigon Bay, fearing retaliation for an attack which they had made
upon the Sioux during the last spring. There were only twelve Frenchmen
at the Sault at the time, and they felt too weak, without aid, to make an
arrest of Folle Avoine.</p>

<p>At the dawn of the next day after the information was received, Du Lhut
embarked with six Frenchmen to seize the murderer, and he also gave a seat
in his canoe to the Jesuit missionary, Engelran. When within a league of
the post at the Sault, he left the canoe, and with Engelran and the Chevalier
de Fourcille, on foot, went through the woods to the mission-house, and the
remaining four&mdash;Baribaud, Le Mere, La Fortune, and Maçons&mdash;proceeded
with the canoe.</p>

<p>Du Lhut, upon his arrival, immediately ordered the arrest of the accused,
and placed him under a guard of six men; then calling a council, he told
the Indians that those guilty of the murder must be punished. But they,
hoping to exculpate the prisoner, said that the murder had been committed
by one Achiganaga and his sons. Peré had been sent to Keweenaw to find
Achiganaga and his children, and when he arrested them they acknowledged
their guilt, and told him that the goods they had stolen were hidden in
certain places. The powder and tobacco were found soaked in water and
useless, and the bodies of the murdered were found in holes in marshy
ground, covered with branches of trees to prevent them from floating. The
goods not damaged were sold at Keweenaw, to the highest bidder among
the traders, for eleven hundred livres, to be paid in beavers to M. de la
Chesnaye. On the 24th of November Peré, at ten o’clock at night, came
and told Du Lhut that he had found eighteen Frenchmen at Keweenaw, and
that he had brought down as prisoners Achiganaga and sons, and had left
them under a guard of twelve Frenchmen at a point twelve leagues from
the Sault. The next day, at dawn, he went back, and at two o’clock in the
afternoon returned with the prisoners, who were placed in a room in the
house where Du Lhut was, and watched by a strong guard, and not allowed
to converse with each other.</p>

<p>On the 26th a council was held. Folle Avoine was allowed two of his
relatives to defend him, and the same privilege was accorded to the others.
He was interrogated, and his answers taken in writing, when they were read
to him, and inquiry made whether the record was correct. He being removed,
Achiganaga was introduced, and in like manner questioned; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
then his sons. The Indians watched the judicial examination with silent
interest, and the chiefs at length said to the prisoners: “It is enough!
You accuse yourselves; the French are masters of your bodies.”</p>

<p>On the 29th all the French at the place were called together. The answers
to the interrogatories by the prisoners were read, and then by vote it
was unanimously decided that they were guilty and ought to die. As the
traders at Keweenaw desired all possible leniency to be shown, Du Lhut
decided to execute only two,&mdash;man for man, for those murdered; and in
this opinion he was sustained by De la Tour, the Superior of the Jesuit missionaries
at the Sault. Folle Avoine and the eldest of Achiganaga’s sons
were selected. Du Lhut writes: “I then returned to the cabin of Brochet
[a chief], with Mess’rs Boisguillot, Peré, De Repentigny, De Manthet, De
la Ferte, and Maçons, where were all the chiefs of the Outawas du Sable,
Outawas Sinagos, Sauteurs, D’Achiliny, a part of the Hurons, and Oumamens,
chief of the Amikoys. I informed them of our decision; ... that
the Frenchmen having been killed by the different tribes, one of each must
die; and that the same death they had caused the French to suffer they
must also suffer.” The Jesuit Fathers then proceeded to baptize the prisoners,
in the belief of the Church of Rome that by the external application
of water they might become citizens of the kingdom of heaven. One hour
later, a procession was formed of forty-two Frenchmen, with Du Lhut at
their head, and the prisoners were taken to a hill, and in the sight of four
hundred Indians the two murderers were shot.</p>

<p>To Du Lhut must always be given the credit of being the first in the
distant West, at the outlet of Lake Superior, to exhibit the majesty of law,
under the forms of the French code. While some of the timid and prejudiced,
in Canada and France, condemned his course as harsh and impolitic,
yet, as the enforcer of a respect for life, he was upheld by the more
thoughtful and reasonable.<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a></p>

<p>During the summer of 1683 (Aug. 10), René Le Gardeur, Sieur de
Beauvais, with thirteen others who had a permit to trade among the Illinois,
departed from Mackinaw, and early in December reached the lower end of
Lake Michigan, and wintered in the valley of the Theakiki or Kankakee
River. About the 10th of March, 1684, while on their way to Fort St.
Louis, on the Illinois River, they were robbed by the Seneca Iroquois of
their seven canoes of merchandise, and after nine days sent back to the
Chicago River with only two canoes and some powder and lead. The Indians,
on the 21st, approached and besieged Fort St. Louis,<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> which was
gallantly defended by the Chevalier de Baugy and the brave Henry Tonty,
the Bras Coupé (Cut Arm), as he was called by them, because he had lost
his hand in battle.<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon the receipt of the news of this incursion, Governor de la Barre,
under a pressure from the merchants of Quebec, whose goods were imperilled,
determined to attack the Iroquois in their own country. Orders
were sent to the posts of the upper lakes for the commandants to bring
down allies to Niagara. While on his way, Du Lhut wrote to De la
Barre:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“As I was leaving Lake Alemepigon [Nepigon], I made in June all the presents
necessary to prevent the savages carrying their beavers to the English. I have met
the Sieur de la Croix, with his two comrades, who gave me your despatches, in which
you demand that I omit no step for the delivery of your letters to the Sieur Chouart at
the River Nelson. To carry out your instructions Monsieur Péré will have to go himself,<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a>
the savages having all at that time gone into the wilderness to gather their blueberries.
The Sieur Péré will have left in August, and during that month will have
delivered your letters to the said Sieur Chouart.<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a></p>

<p>“It remains for me to assure you that all the savages of the north have great confidence
in me, and this makes me promise you that before two years have passed not
a single savage will visit the English at Hudson’s Bay. This they have all promised,
and have bound themselves thereto by the presents which I have given or caused to
be given.</p>

<p>“The Klistinos, Assenepoualacs, Sapiniere, Opemens Dacheliny, Outouloubys, and
Tabitibis, who comprise the nations who are west of the Sea of the North, having
promised next spring to be at the fort which I have constructed near the River à la
Maune, at the end of Lake Alemepigon,<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> and next summer I shall construct one in
the country of the Klistinos, which will be an effectual barrier.... It is necessary,
to carry out my promises, that my brother<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> should, in the early spring [of 1685], go
up again, with two canoes loaded with powder, lead, fusils, hatchets, tobacco, and
necessary presents.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Durantaye, Du Lhut, and Nicholas Perrot left Mackinaw with one hundred
and fifty Frenchmen and about five hundred Indians<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> to join De la
Barre’s army; and they had not been six hours at Niagara, on the 6th of
September, before orders were received that their services were not needed,
as the French troops were suffering from sickness, and a truce had been
made with the Iroquois.<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> Du Lhut and the other Frenchmen slowly returned
to their posts, and when the new governor (Denonville) arrived, he
wrote to De la Durantaye at Mackinaw, and sent orders to Du Lhut, who
was at a great distance beyond, to inform him of the number of allies he
could furnish in case of a war against the Iroquois.</p>

<p>Nicholas Perrot, in the spring of 1685, was commissioned to go to
Green Bay and have chief command there, and of any countries he might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
discover.<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> He left Montreal with twenty men, and arriving at Green Bay,
some Indians told him that they had visited countries toward the setting
sun, where they obtained the blue and green stones suspended from their
ears and noses, and that they saw horses and men like Frenchmen,&mdash;probably
the Spaniards of New Mexico; and others said that they had obtained
hatchets from persons who lived in a house that walked on the water in the
Assineboine region,&mdash;alluding to the English established at Hudson’s Bay.
At the portage between the Fox and Wisconsin rivers thirteen Hurons were
met, who were bitterly opposed to the establishment of a post near the
Sioux. After reaching the Mississippi, Perrot sent a few Winnebagoes to
notify the Aiouez (Ioways) who roamed on the prairies beyond, that the
French had ascended the river, and that they would indicate their stopping-place
by kindling a fire. A place was found suitable for a post,<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> where
there was wood, at the foot of a high hill (<i>au pied d’une montagne</i>), behind
which there was a large prairie.<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> In eleven days a number of Ioways arrived
at the Mississippi, about twenty-five miles above, and Perrot ascended
to meet them; but as he and his men drew near, the Indian women ran up
the bluffs and hid in the woods. But twenty of the braves met him and
bore him to the chief’s lodge, and he, bending over Perrot, began to weep,
and allowed the tears to fall upon his guest. After he had exhausted himself,
the principal men continued this wetting process. Buffalo tongues
were then boiled in an earthen pot, and after being cut into small pieces,
the chief took a piece, and, as a mark of respect, placed it in Perrot’s
mouth. During the winter Perrot traded with the Sioux; and by 1686 a
post was established on the Wisconsin shore of Lake Pepin, just above its
entrance, called “Fort St. Antoine.”<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a></p>

<p>Denonville discovered upon his arrival at Quebec that the policy which
De la Barre had pursued in making peace had rendered the Iroquois more
insolent, and had made the allies of the French upon the upper lakes discontented,
on account of their long and fruitless voyage to Niagara. He
therefore determined, as soon as he could gather a sufficient force, to march
into the Iroquois country<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> “and not chastise them by halves, but if possible
annihilate them.” Orders were again sent to the posts at Mackinaw and
Green Bay to prepare for another expedition against the Seneca Iroquois.
Perrot at the time he received the order to return was among the Sioux,
and his canoes had been broken by the ice. During the summer of 1686
he visited the Miamis, sixty leagues distant. Upon his return he perceived
a great smoke, and at first thought it was a war-party going against
the Sioux. Fortunately he met a Maskouten chief, who had been at the
post to visit him, and from him he learned that the Foxes, Kickapoos,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Maskouten, and others had determined to pillage the post, kill its inmates,
and then go forward and attack the Sioux. Hurrying on, he reached the
post, and was told that on that very day three spies had been there and discovered
that there were only six men in charge. The next day two more
appeared, but Perrot had taken the precaution to put loaded guns at the
door of each hut, and made his men frequently change their clothes. To
the query of the savage spies, “How many French were there?” the reply
was, “Forty, and that more were daily expected, who had been on a buffalo
hunt, and that the guns were loaded and the knives well sharpened.”
They were then told to go back to their camp and bring a chief of each
tribe; and that if Indians in large numbers came they would be fired at.</p>

<p>In accordance with this message, six chiefs presented themselves, and
after their bows and arrows had been taken from them, they were invited to
Perrot’s cabin, where he gave them something to eat and tobacco to smoke.
Looking at Perrot’s loaded guns, they asked “if he were afraid of his children?”
He answered, “No.” They continued, “Are you displeased?”
To this he said, “I have good reason to be. The Spirit has warned me of
your designs; you will take my things away and put me in the kettle, and
proceed against the Nadouaissioux. The Spirit told me to be on my guard,
and he would help me.” Astonished at these words, they confessed he had
spoken the truth. That night the chiefs slept within the stockade, and
early the next morning a part of the hostile force came and wished to
trade. Perrot had now only fifteen men, and arresting the chiefs, he told
them he would break their heads if they did not make the Indians go away.
One of the chiefs, therefore, stood on the gate of the fort and said to the
warriors: “Do not advance, young men, the Spirit has warned Metaminens
of your designs.” The advice was followed, and the chiefs, receiving
some presents, also retired.</p>

<p>A few days after, Perrot returned to Green Bay in accordance with the
order of the Governor of Canada. His position toward the Jesuits at this
point was different from that of La Salle. This latter explorer had declared
that the missionaries were more anxious to convert, at their blacksmith
shop, iron into implements, to be exchanged for beaver, than to convert
souls.</p>

<p>After being buried in the earth for years, there has been discovered a
silver soleil or ostensorium, fifteen inches high, and weighing twenty ounces,
intended for the consecrated wafer;<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> around the oval base of the rim is the
following inscription in French: “This soleil was given by M<sup>r</sup> Nicholas
Perrot, to the mission of St. Francis Xavier, at the Bay of Puans, 1686.”<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a></p>

<p>Governor Dongan of New York, although an Irishman and Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Catholic, was aggressive in the interests of England, and asserted the right
of traders from Albany to go among the Indians of the Northwest. As
early as 1685 he licensed several persons, among whom was La Fontaine
Marion, a Canadian, to trade for beaver in the Ottawas country; and their
journey was successful, and created
consternation at Quebec.
Governor Denonville wrote to
Seignelay of the pretences of the
English, who claimed the lakes
to the South Sea. His language
was terse and emphatic:
“Missilimakinak is theirs. They
have taken its latitude, have
been to trade there with our
Outawas and Huron Indians,
who received them cordially on
account of the bargains they
gave by selling them merchandise
for beaver at a much higher
price than we. Unfortunately
we had but very few Frenchmen
there at that time.”</p>

<p>A despatch on the 6th of
June, 1686, was sent to Du Lhut,
that he should go and establish
a post at some point on the
shore of St. Clair River, between
Lake Erie and Lake Huron,
which would serve as a protection
for friendly Indians, and
a barrier to the English traders.
After he had built the post he
was ordered to leave it in command
of a lieutenant and twenty-eight
men, return to Mackinaw,
and then take thirty men more
to the post, which was called
Fort St. Joseph. A party of English, under Captain Thomas Roseboome,
of Albany, consisting of twenty-nine whites and five Indians, and La Fontaine
as interpreter, in the spring of 1687 were arrested by Durantaye on
Lake Huron, twenty leagues from Mackinaw, and their <i>eau de vie</i> (brandy)
given to the Indians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>In June, Durantaye left Mackinaw with allies for Denonville, and was
afterward followed by Perrot; and at Fort St. Joseph he met Du Lhut and
Henry Tonty, who had arrived from Fort St. Louis with a few Illinois Indians.<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a>
After the united company had left this post, they met in St. Clair
River a second party of Englishmen, consisting of twenty-one whites, six
Indians, and eight prisoners, in charge of Major Patrick Macgregory, of
Albany, a native of Scotland. These were also arrested, making about
sixty then in the hands of the French.</p>

<p>On the 27th of June, Durantaye and associates, to the number of one
hundred and seventy Frenchmen, and about four hundred Indians, arrived
at Niagara. Sieur de la Foret, who had been with Tonty at Fort St. Louis,
on the 1st of July
reported their arrival
to Denonville, then
at Fort Frontenac.
The Governor was
pleased to hear of the
capture of the English,
and in a subsequent
despatch
wrote: “It is certain
that had the two English
detachments not
been stopped and pillaged,
had their brandy
and other goods
entered Michillimaquina,
all our Frenchmen
would have had their throats cut by a revolt of all the Hurons and
Outaouas, whose example would have been followed by all the other far
nations, in consequence of the presents which had been secretly sent to
the Indians.”</p>

     <div class="cf"><p class="pc">BOTTOM OF THE SOLEIL.</p>
</div></div>

<p>On the 10th of July, as the Canadian and French troops entered Irondequoit
Bay, they were elated by the approach, under sail, of the Indian allies
from Mackinaw who on the 6th had left Niagara. On the 12th, the march
to the Seneca village was begun; but the story of it has been told elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a></p>

<p>The officers who came from the posts of the upper lakes were well
spoken of by Denonville. In one of his despatches he writes: “A half-pay
captaincy being vacant, I gave it to Sieur de la Durantaye, who since I
have been in this country has done good service among the Outawas, and
has been very economical in labor and expense in executing the orders he
received from me. He is a man of rank, unfortunate in his affairs, and who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
by his great assiduity at Missillimakinak, efficiently carried out the instructions
to seize the English; he arrested one of the parties within two days’
journey of Missillimakinak. Sieurs de Tonty and Du Lhut have acquitted
themselves very well; all would richly deserve some reward.”</p>

<p>After the allies had left Niagara for the scene of battle, Greysolon de la
Tourette, a brother of Du Lhut, described as “an intelligent lad,” arrived
there from Lake Nepigon, north of Lake Superior, in a canoe, without an
escort. Denonville a few weeks after wrote: “Du Lhut’s brother, who has
recently arrived from the rivers above the Lake of the Allemepigons, assures
me that he saw more than fifteen hundred persons come to trade with him,
and they were very sorry he had not sufficient goods to satisfy them. They
are of the tribes accustomed to resort to the English at Port Nelson and
River Bourbon.”<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a></p>

<p>The destruction of the Seneca villages having been completed, Du Lhut,
with his brave cousin Henry Tonty, returned in September to Fort St. Joseph,<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a>
near the entrance of Lake Huron, garrisoned at his own charges by
<i>coureurs des bois</i>, who had in the spring sown some bushels of Turkey
wheat. The next year, to allay the irritation of the Iroquois, Governor
Denonville issued an order to abandon the fort, and on the 27th of August
the buildings were destroyed by fire.</p>

<p>Perrot, in 1688, was ordered to return to his post on the Upper Mississippi,
and take formal possession of the country in the King’s name. With
a party of forty men, he left Montreal to trade with the Sioux, who, according
to La Potherie, “were very distant, and could not trade with us easily,
as the other tribes and the Outagamis [Foxes] boasted of having cut off
the passage thereto.” Reaching Green Bay in the fall of the year, Perrot
was met by a deputation of Foxes, and afterward visited their village. In
the chief’s lodge there was placed before him broiled venison, and for the
rest of the French raw meat was served; but he refused to eat, because,
he said, “meat did not give him any spirit. But he would take some
when they were more reasonable.” He then chided them for not having
gone, as requested by the Governor of Canada, on the expedition against
the Senecas. Urging them to proceed on the beaver hunt, and to fight only
the Iroquois, and leaving a few Frenchmen to trade, he proceeded toward
the Sioux country. Arriving at the portage, the ice formed some impediment,
but, aided by Pottawattamies, his men transported their goods to the
Wisconsin River, which was not frozen. Ascending the Mississippi, he
proceeded to the post which he occupied before he was summoned to fight
the Senecas.</p>

<p>As soon as the ice left the river, in the spring of 1689, the Sioux came
down and escorted Perrot to one of their villages, where he was received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
with much enthusiasm. He was carried around upon a beaver robe, followed
by a long line of warriors, each bearing a pipe and singing. Then, taking
him to the chief’s lodge, several wept over his head, as the Ioways had
done when he first visited the Upper Mississippi. After he had left, in 1686,
a Sioux chief, knowing that few Frenchmen were at the fort, had come down
with one hundred warriors to pillage it. Of this, complaint was made by
Perrot, and the guilty leader came near being put to death by his tribe.
As they were about to leave the Sioux village, one of his men told Perrot
that a box of goods had been stolen, and he ordered a cup of water to be
brought, into which he poured some brandy. He then addressed the Indians,
and told them he would dry up their marshes if the goods were not
restored, at the same time setting on fire the brandy in the cup. The savages,
astonished, and supposing that he possessed supernatural powers, soon
detected the thief, and the goods were returned.</p>

<p>On the 8th of May, 1689, at the post St. Antoine, on the Wisconsin side
of Lake Pepin, a short distance above the Chippewa River, in the presence
of the Jesuit missionary, Joseph J. Marest, Boisguillot,<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> a trader near the
mouth of the Wisconsin River, Pierre Le Sueur, whose name was afterward
identified with the exploration of the Minnesota, and a few others, Perrot
took possession of the country of the rivers St. Croix, St. Pierre, and the
region of Mille Lacs, in the name of the King of France.</p>

<p>When he returned to Montreal, he found a great change had occurred in
political affairs. It had become evident that the Iroquois were mere agents
of the English. The Albany traders had searched the land between the
Hudson River and Lake Erie, and had made a report that the Valley of the
Genesee was fertile and beautiful to behold, and every year an increasing
number of pale-faces wandered among the Indian villages toward Lake Ontario.
Old officers in Canada saw that their only hope was to destroy the
source of supply to the Iroquois. The question to be determined was
whether the King of France or the King of England should control the
region of the Great Lakes. Chevalier de Callières, who had seen much
service in Europe, and was in command of the troops in Canada, insisted
that decisive steps should be taken. The crisis was hastened by the arrival
of the intelligence that a revolution had occurred in England, and that
William and Mary had been acknowledged. Callières wrote to Seignelay
relative to the condition of affairs: “It would be idle to flatter ourselves with
the hope to find them improved since the usurpation of the Prince of
Orange, who will be assuredly acknowledged by Sir Andros,<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> who is a Protestant,
born in the Island of Jersey, and by New York, the inhabitants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
whereof are mostly Dutch, who planted this colony under the name of
New Netherland, all of whom are Protestant.”</p>

<p>He urged that the war should be carried into New York, and that a force
be sent strong enough to seize Albany, and then to move down and capture
Manhattan. “It will give his Majesty,” he said, “one of the finest harbors
in America, accessible at almost all seasons, and it will give one of the finest
countries of America, in a milder and more fertile climate than that of
Canada.” The sequel was a conflict of drilled troops under European
officers upon the borders of New England and New York.</p>

<h3><a name="c196" id="c196">CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION.</a></h3>

<p class="p2"><b>1609-1640.</b>&mdash;The <i>Voyages</i> of Champlain, as published in 1632 at Paris, are valuable
in facts pertaining to discovery along the shores of Lake Champlain and Lake Huron;
but the book is the subject of special treatment in another chapter.<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> The <i>Grand Voyage</i>
of Sagard<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> contains little more than what may be found in Champlain and the <i>Relations</i>
of the Jesuit missionaries. Charlevoix mentions that Sagard passed “some time among
the Hurons, but had not time to see things well enough, still less to verify all that was
told him.”</p>

<p class="p1"><b>1640-1660.</b>&mdash;Benjamin Sulté, in his “Notes on Jean Nicolet,” printed in the <i>Wisconsin
Historical Society Collections</i>, viii. 188-194,<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> shows that Nicolet, the trader, must
have visited Green Bay between July, 1634, and July, 1635, because this interval is the
only period of his life when he cannot be found on the shores of the St. Lawrence. The
recently published <i>History of the Discovery of the Northwest in 1634 by Jean Nicolet,
with a Sketch of his Life</i> by C. W. Butterfield, Cincinnati, 1881, is a useful book, and
gives evidence that Nicolet did not descend the Wisconsin River.</p>

<p>The <i>Relations des Jésuites</i> (of which a full bibliographical account is appended to the
following chapter) are important sources for the tracing of these western explorations.</p>

<p>The <i>Relation</i> of 1640 has an extract from a letter of Paul Le Jeune, in which, after
giving the names of the tribes of the region of the Lakes, he adds that “the Sieur
Nicolet, interpreter of the Algonquin and Huron languages for Messieurs de la Nouvelle
France, has given me the names of these natives he has visited, for the most part
in their country.” This <i>Relation</i> shows how near an approach Nicolet made to discovering
the Mississippi. See in this connection Margry’s “Les Normands dans l’Ohio
et le Mississippi,” in the <i>Journal général de l’Instruction publique</i>, 30 Juillet, 1862.
Shea, <i>Mississippi Valley</i>, p. xx, contends that Nicolet reached the river or its affluents.
The <i>Relation</i> of 1643 records the death of Nicolet, with some particulars of his life.</p>

<p>For slight notices of the period, with dates of the departure and arrival of traders and
missionaries, there is serviceable aid to be had from <i>Le Journal des Jésuites publié d’après
le Manuscrit original conservé aux Archives du Séminaire de Québec</i>. Par MM. les
Abbés Laverdière et Casgrain. Quebec, 1871.<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> Under date of Aug. 21, 1660, is noted the
arrival of a party of Ottawas at Montreal, who departed the next day, and arrived at Three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
Rivers on the 24th, and on the 27th left. It adds: “They were in number three hundred.
Des Grosilleres was in their company, who had gone to them the year before. They had
departed from Lake Superior with one hundred canoes; forty turned back, and sixty
arrived, loaded with peltry to the value of 200,000 livres. At Montreal they left to the
value of 50,000 livres, and brought the rest to Three Rivers. They come in twenty-six
days, but are two months in going back. Des Grosillers wintered with the Bœuf tribe,
who were about four thousand, and belonged to the sedentary Nadouesseronons [Dakotahs].
The Father Menar, the Father Albanel, and six other Frenchmen went back with
them.”</p>

<p>There appears to be no uniformity in the spelling of the name of Groseilliers. Under
May, 1662, is this entry: “I departed from Quebek on the 3d for Three Rivers; there
met Des Grosillers, who was going to the Sea of the North. He left Quebek the night
before with ten men.” Under August, 1663, is the following: “The 5th returned those
who had been three years among the Outaoouac; nine Frenchmen went, and seven
returned. The Father Menar and his man, Jean Guerin, one of our <i>donnés</i>, had died,&mdash;the
Father Menar the 7th or 8th of August, 1661, and Jean Guerin in September,
1662. The party arrived at Montreal on the 25th of July, with thirty-five canoes and one
hundred and fifty men.” Of Creuxius’ <i>Historia</i> and its relations to the missionaries’
reports, there is an account in the next chapter.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>1660-1680.</b>&mdash;The documents from the French archives in the Parliament Library at
Ottawa, Canada (copies in manuscript), and those translated and printed in the <i>New York
Col. Docs.</i>, vol. ix., give much information on this period; and so do the <i>Jesuit Relations</i>,
and the first volume of the Collections edited by Margry and published at Paris in 1875.<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a></p>

Compagnie de Jésus</i>, Leipsic and Paris, 1864,<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> was examined by Charlevoix one hundred
and fifty years ago, when it was in manuscript, and afforded him useful information. It is
the only work referring to the traders at the extremity of Lake Superior between 1660 and
1670, and to the migrations of the Hurons from the Mississippi to the Black River, and
from thence to Lake Superior. Much of interest is also derived from the <i>Histoire de
l’Amérique septentrionale</i>. Par M. de Bacqueville de la Potherie, Paris, 1722, 4 vols.<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a></p>

<p class="p1"><b>1680-1690.</b>&mdash;There are differences of statements regarding the Upper Mississippi
Valley, but nevertheless much information of importance, in the letter of La Salle from
Fort Frontenac, in August, 1682,<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> in Du Lhut’s <i>Mémoire</i> of 1683, as printed by Harrisse,<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a>

<p>Perrot, in the work already quoted, gives the best account of this region from 1683
to 1690.</p>

<p>For the whole period of the exploration of the Great Lakes, the works among the
secondary authorities of the chief value are Charlevoix in the last century, and Parkman

<h3><a name="c198" id="c198">EDITORIAL NOTE.</a></h3>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE local historical work of the Northwest
has been done in part under the auspices
of various State and sectional historical societies.
The Ohio Society, organized in 1831, became
later inanimate, but was revived in 1868, and
ought to hold a more important position among
kindred bodies than it does. Mr. Baldwin has
given an account of the historical and pioneer
societies of Ohio in the Western Reserve and
Northern Ohio Historical Society’s <i>Tracts</i>, no.
27; and this latter Society, organized in 1867,
with the Licking County Pioneer Historical Society,
organized the same year, and the Firelands
Historical Society, organized in 1857, have increased
the historical literature of the State by
various publications elucidating in the main the
settlements of the last century. The youngest
of the kindred associations, the Historical and
Geographical Society of Toledo, was begun
in 1871. The State, however, is fortunate in
having an excellent <i>Bibliography of Ohio</i> (1880),
embracing fourteen hundred titles, exclusive of
public documents, which was compiled by Peter
G. Thomson; while the <i>Americana</i> Catalogues
of Robert Clarke &amp; Co., of Cincinnati, are the
completest booksellers’ lists of that kind which
are published in America. The <i>Ohio Valley
Historical Series</i>, published by the same house,
has not as yet included any publication relating
to the period of the French claims to its territory.
The earliest <i>History of Ohio</i> is by Caleb
Atwater, published in 1838; but the <i>History</i> by
James W. Taylor&mdash;“First Period, 1650-1787”&mdash;is
wholly confined to the Jesuits’ missions,
the wars of the Eries and Iroquois, and the
later border warfare. (Field, <i>Indian Bibliography</i>,
no. 1,535.) Henry Howe’s <i>Historical Collections
of Ohio</i>, originally issued in 1848, and
again in 1875, is a repository of facts pertaining
for the most part to later times.</p>

<p class="p2">The Historical Society of Indiana, founded
in 1831, hardly justifies its name, so far as appears
from any publications. The chief <i>History
of Indiana</i> is that by John B. Dillon, which, as
originally issued in 1843, came down to 1816;
but the edition of 1859 continues the record to
1856. The first three chapters are given to the
French missionaries and the natives. (Field,
<i>Indian Bibliography</i>, nos. 429, 430; Sabin, vol.
v. no. 20,172.) A popular conglomerate work
is <i>The Illustrated History of Indiana</i>, 1876, by
Goodrich and Tuttle. A few local histories
touch the early period, like John Law’s <i>Colonial
History of Vincennes</i>, 1858; Wallace A. Brice’s
<i>History of Fort Wayne</i>, 1868; H. L. Hosmer’s
<i>Early History of the Maumee Valley</i>, Toledo,
1858; and H. S. Knapp’s <i>History of the Maumee
Valley from 1680</i>, Toledo, 1872, which is, however,
very scant on the early history.</p>

<p class="p2">In Illinois there is no historical association
to represent the State; but the Historical Society
of Chicago (begun in 1856), though suffering
the loss of its collections of seventeen
thousand volumes in the great fire of 1871, still
survives.</p>

<p>The principal histories of the State touching
the French occupation are Henry Brown’s <i>History
of Illinois</i>, New York, 1844; John Reynolds’s
<i>Pioneer History of Illinois</i>, Belleville, 1852, now
become scarce; and Davidson and Stuvé’s <i>Complete
History of Illinois</i>, 1673-1873, Springfield,
1874. The <i>Historical Series</i> issued by Robert
Fergus pertain in large measure to Chicago,
and, except J. D. Caton’s “Last of the Illinois,
and Sketch of the Potawatomies,” has, so far as
printed, little of interest earlier than the English
occupation. H. H. Hurlbut’s <i>Chicago Antiquities</i>,
1881, has an account of the early discovery
of the portage.</p>

<p class="p2">The Michigan Pioneer Society was founded
in 1874, and has printed three volumes of <i>Pioneer
Collections</i>, 1877-1880. The Houghton
County Historical Society, devoting itself to the
history of the region near Lake Superior,<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> dates
from 1866. It has published nothing of importance.
The State of Michigan secured, through
General Cass, while he was the minister of the
United States at Paris, transcripts of a large
number of documents relating to its early history.
The Historical Society of Michigan was
begun in 1828, and during the few years following
it printed several Annual Addresses and a
volume of <i>Transactions</i>. Every trace of the Society
had nearly vanished, when in 1857 it was
revived. (<i>Historical Magazine</i>, i. 353.) The
principal histories of the State are James H.
Lanman’s <i>History of Michigan</i>, New York, 1839;
Electra M. Sheldon’s <i>Early History of Michigan,
from the First Settlement to 1815</i>, New York,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
1856, which is largely given to an account of
the Jesuit missions;<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> Charles R. Tuttle’s <i>General
History of Michigan</i>, Detroit, 1874; James
Valentine Campbell’s <i>Outlines of the Political
History of Michigan</i>, Detroit, 1876. (Cf.
Clarke’s <i>Bibliotheca Americana</i>, 1878, p. 92; 1883,
p. 169; Sabin, <i>Dictionary</i>, vol. xii. p. 141.) A
few of the sectional histories, like W. P. Strickland’s
<i>Old Mackinaw</i>, Philadelphia, 1860, touch
slightly the French period. A brief sketch of
Mackinaw Island by Lieutenant Dwight H.
Kelton, U. S. A., includes extracts from the
registers of the Catholic Church at Mackinaw,
and a list of the French commanders at that
post during the eighteenth century.</p>

<p class="p2">The Historical Society of Wisconsin was
founded in 1849, and reorganized in 1854. It
has devoted itself to forming a large library,
and has published nine volumes of <i>Collections</i>,
etc. (Joseph Sabin in <i>American Bibliopolist</i>,
vi. 158; Field, <i>Indian Bibliography</i>, no. 1,688).
Mr. D. S. Durrie published a bibliography of
Wisconsin in <i>Historical Magazine</i>, xvi. 29, and a
tract on the <i>Early Outposts of Wisconsin</i> in 1873.
A paper on the “First Page of the History of
Wisconsin” is in the <i>American Antiquarian</i>,
April, 1878. The principal histories of the
State are I. A. Lapham’s <i>Wisconsin</i>, Milwaukee,
1846, which lightly touches the earliest period;
William R. Smith’s Wisconsin (vol. i., historical;
vol. ii., not published; vol. iii., documentary,
translating in part the <i>Jesuit Relations</i> from
the set in Harvard College Library), Madison,
1854; and Charles R. Tuttle’s <i>Illustrated History
of Wisconsin</i>, Madison and Boston, 1875.</p>

<p class="p2">The Minnesota Historical Society was organized
in 1849, and began the publication of its
<i>Annals</i> in 1850, completing a volume in 1856.
This volume was reissued in 1872 as vol. i. of
its <i>Collections</i>, and includes papers on the origin
of the name of Minnesota and the early nomenclature
of the region, and papers by Mr. Neill
on the French Voyageurs, the early Indian trade
and traders,<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> and early notices of the Dakotas.
In vol. ii. Mr. Neill has a paper on “The Early
French Forts and Footprints in the Valley of
the Upper Mississippi;”<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> and Mr. A. J. Hill
has examined the geography of Perrot so far as
it relates to Minnesota territory. In vol. iii.
there is a bibliography of the State; in vol. iv., a
<i>History of St. Paul</i>, by John Fletcher Williams,
which but briefly touches the period of exploration.
The State Historical Society of Minnesota
lost a considerable part of its collections
in the fire of March 11, 1881, which burned the
State capitol,&mdash;as detailed in its <i>Report</i> for 1883.</p>

<p>The principal and sufficient account of the
State’s history is Edward D. Neill’s <i>History of
Minnesota from the Earliest French Explorations</i>,
Philadelphia, 1858, which in 1883 reached an improved
fifth edition, and is supplemented by his
<i>Minnesota Explorers and Pioneers, 1659-1858</i>,
published in 1881. In 1858 an edition was also
issued, of one hundred copies, on large paper,
illustrated with forty-five quarto steel plates,
engraved from paintings chiefly by Captain Seth
Eastman, U. S. Army.</p>

<p class="p2">The Historical Society of Iowa was founded
in 1857, and began the publication of its <i>Annals</i>
in 1863. The principal account of the

<p class="pc1 mid">HISTORICAL SOURCES AND ATTENDANT CARTOGRAPHY.</p>

<p class="pc1">BY THE EDITOR.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE principal sources for the cartographical part of this study are as follows: The
collection of manuscript copies<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> of maps in the French Archives which was formed
by Mr. Parkman, and which he has described in his <i>La Salle</i> (p. 449), and which is now
in Harvard College Library; a collection of manuscript and printed maps called <i>Cartographie
du Canada</i>, formed by Henry Harrisse in Paris, and which in 1872 passed into
the hands of Samuel L. M. Barlow, Esq., of New York, by whose favor the Editor has had
it in his possession for study; the collection of copies made by Dr. J. G. Kohl which
is now in the Library of the State Department at Washington, and which through the
kind offices of Theodore F. Dwight, Esq., of that department, and by permission of the
Secretary of State, have been intrusted to the Editor’s temporary care; and the collection
of printed maps now in Harvard College Library, formed mainly by Professor Ebeling
nearly a hundred years ago, and which came to that library, with all of Ebeling’s books, as
a gift from the late Colonel Israel Thorndike, in 1818.<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a></p>

<p>The completest printed enumeration of maps is in the section on “Cartographie” in
Harrisse’s <i>Notes pour servir à l’histoire ... de la Nouvelle France, 1545-1700</i>, Paris,
1872, and this has served the Editor as a convenient check-list. A special paper on “Early
Maps of Ohio and the West” constitutes no. 25 of the <i>Tracts</i> of the Western Reserve and
Northern Ohio Historical Society. It was issued in 1875, and has been published
separately, and is the work of Mr. C. C. Baldwin, secretary of that Society, whose own
collection of maps is described by S. D. Peet in the <i>American Antiquarian</i>, i. 21. See
also the <i>Transactions</i> (1879) of the Minnesota Historical Society.</p>

<p>The main guide for the historical portion of this essay has been the <i>La Salle</i> of
Parkman.<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a></p>

<p>There are in the Dépôt de la Marine in Paris two copies of a rough sketch on parchment,
showing the Great Lakes, which were apparently made between 1640 and 1650. They
have neither maker’s name nor date, but clearly indicate a state of knowledge derived from
the early discovery of the Upper Lakes by way of the Ottawa, and before the southern part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
of Lake Huron had been explored, and found to connect with Lake Erie. The maker
must have been ignorant of the knowledge, or discredited it, which Champlain possessed
in 1632 when he connected Ontario and Huron. Indications of settlements at Montreal
would place the date of this map after 1642; and it may have embodied the current traditions
of the explorations of Brulé and Nicolet, though it omits all indications of Lake
Michigan, which Nicolet had discovered. Though rude in many ways, it gives one of the
earliest sketches of the Bras d’Or in Cape Breton. The channel connecting the Atlantic
and the St. Lawrence, if standing for anything, must represent the Connecticut and the
Chaudière. Dr. Kohl, in a marginal note on a copy of this map in his Washington Collection,
while referring to the uninterrupted water-way by the Ottawa, remarks on a custom,
not uncommon on the early maps, of leaving out the portages; and the same suspicion may
attach to the New England water-way here given. A note on the map gives the distance
as three hundred leagues from Gaspé to the extremity of Lake Ontario; two hundred
more to the land of the buffaloes; two hundred additional to the region of apes and
parrots; then four hundred to the Sea of New Spain; and thence fifteen or sixteen hundred
more to the Indies. A legend in the neighborhood of Lake Superior confirms other mention
of the early discovery of copper in that region: “In the little lake near the mountains
are found pieces of copper of five and six hundred pounds’ weight.”</p>

<p>At a later day La Salle had learned, from some Senecas who visited his post at Lachine,
of a great river, rising in their country and flowing to the sea; and, with many
geographers of his day, captivated with a promised passage to India, he preferred to believe
that it emptied into the Gulf of California.<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a></p>

<p class="pf400">There are in the Kohl Collection, in the

<p>He was determined to track it; and
gaining some money by selling his grant at Lachine, and procuring the encouragement
of Talon and Courcelles, he formed an alliance for the journey with two priests of the
Seminary at Montreal, Dollier de Casson and Galinée, who were about going westward
on a missionary undertaking. La Salle started with them on the 6th of July, 1669,
with some followers, and a party of Senecas as guides. The savages led them across
Lake Ontario to a point on the southern shore nearest to their villages, which the party
visited in the hope of securing other guides to the
great river of which they were in search. Failing
in this, they made their way to the western extremity
of the lake, where they fell in with Joliet, as
mentioned in the preceding chapter. La Salle now
learned Joliet’s route; but he was not convinced
that it opened to him the readiest way to the great
river of the Indians, though the Sulpitians were resolved to take Joliet’s route north
of Lake Erie. When these priests returned to Montreal, in June, 1670, they brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
back little of consequence, except the data to make the earliest map which we have of
the Upper Lakes, and of which a sketch is given herewith.</p>

<p>What La Salle did after parting with the Sulpitians in 1669 is a question over which
there has been much dispute. The absence of any definite knowledge of his movements
for the next two years leaves ample room for conjecture, and Margry believes
that maps which he made of his wanderings in this interval were in existence up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
the middle of the last century. It is from statements regarding such maps given in a
letter of an aged niece of La Salle in 1756, as well as from other data, that Margry has
endeavored to place within these two years what he supposes to have been a successful
attempt on La Salle’s part to reach the Great River of the West. If an anonymous paper
(“Histoire de Monsieur de la Salle”) published by Margry<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> is to be believed, La Salle
told the writer of it in Paris,&mdash;seemingly in 1678,&mdash;that after leaving Galinée he went to
Onondaga (?), where he got guides, and descending a stream, reached the Ohio (?), and went
down that river. How far? Margry thinks that he reached the Mississippi: Parkman
demurs, and claims that the story will not bear out the theory that he ever reached the
mouth of the Ohio; but it seems probable that he reached the rapids at Louisville, and
that from this point he retraced his steps alone, his men having abandoned him to seek the
Dutch and English settlements. Parkman finds enough amid the geographical confusions
of this “Histoire” to think that upon the whole the paper agrees with La Salle’s memorial
to Frontenac in 1677, in which he claimed to have discovered the Ohio and to have coursed
it to the rapids, and that it confirms the statements which Joliet has attached to the
Ohio in his maps, to the effect that it was by this stream La Salle went, “pour aller

<p>The same “Histoire” also represents that in the following year (1671) La Salle took the
course in which he had refused to follow Galinée, and entering Lake Michigan, found the
Chicago portage, and descending the Illinois, reached the Mississippi. This descent
Parkman is constrained to reject, mainly for the reason that from 1673 to 1678 Joliet’s
claim to the discovery of the Mississippi was a notorious one, believed by Frontenac and
by all others, and that there was no reason why La Salle for eight years should have concealed
any prior knowledge. The discrediting of this claim is made almost, if not quite,
conclusive by no mention being made of such discovery in the memorial of La Salle’s
kindred to the King for compensation for his services, and by the virtual admission of La
Salle’s friends of the priority of Joliet’s discovery in a memorial to Seignelay, which Margry
also prints.<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a></p>

<p>In 1672 some Indians from the West had told Marquette at the St. Esprit mission
of a great river which they had crossed. Reports of it also came about the same
time to Allouez and Dablon, who were at work establishing a mission at Green Bay;
and in the <i>Relation</i> of 1672 the hope of being able to reach this Mississippi water is
expressed.</p>

<p>Frontenac on his arrival felt that the plan of pushing the actual possession of France
beyond the lakes was the first thing to be accomplished, and Talon, as we have seen, on
leaving for France recommended Joliet<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> as the man best suited to do it. Jacques Marquette
joined him at Point St. Ignace. The Jesuit was eight years the senior of the fur-trader,
and of a good family from the North of France.</p>

<p>Their course has been sketched
in the preceding chapter. They seemed to have reached a conviction that the Great River
flowed into the Gulf of Mexico. Their return was by the Illinois River and the Chicag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
portage.<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> During the four months of their absence, says Parkman, they had paddled their
canoes somewhat more than two thousand five hundred miles.</p>

<p>While Marquette remained at the mission Joliet returned to Quebec. What Joliet
contributed to the history of this discovery can be found in a letter on his map, later to
be given in fac-simile; a letter dated Oct. 10, 1674, given by Harrisse;<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> the letter of
Frontenac announcing the discovery, which must have been derived from Joliet,<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> and the
oral accounts which Joliet gave to the writer of the “Détails sur le voyage de Louis
Joliet; and a Relation de la descouverte de plusieurs pays situez au midi de la Nouvelle
France, faite en 1673,” both of which are printed by Margry.<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a></p>

<p>Within a few years there has been produced a map which seems to have been made
by Joliet immediately after his return to Montreal. This would make it the earliest map
of the Mississippi based on actual knowledge, and the first of a series accredited to
Joliet. It is called <i>Nouvelle découverte de plusieurs nations dans la Nouvelle France en
l’année 1673 et 1674</i>. Gabriel Gravier first made this map known through an <i>Étude sur
une carte inconnue; la première dressée par L. Joliet en 1674, après son exploration du
Mississippi auec Jacques Marquette en 1673</i>.<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> A sketch of it, with a key, is given herewith.
The tablet in the sketch marks the position of Joliet’s letter to Frontenac, of which
a reduced fac-simile is also annexed.</p>

<p>“In this epistle,” says Mr. Neill, “Joliet mentions that he had presented a map showing
the situation of the Lakes upon which there is navigation for more than 1,200 leagues
from east to west, and that he had given to the great river beyond the Lakes, which he
had discovered in the years 1673-1674, the designation of Buade, the family name of
Frontenac.<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> He adds a glowing description of the prairies, the groves, and the forests,”
and writes of the quail (<i>cailles</i>) in the fields and the parrot (<i>perroquet</i>) in the woods.
He concludes his communication as follows: “By one of the large rivers which comes
from the west and empties into the River Buade, one will find a route to the Red Sea”
[Mer vermeille, <i>i. e.</i> Gulf of California].</p>

<p>“I saw a village which was not more than five
days’ journey from a tribe which traded with the tribes of California;<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> if I had arrived two
days before, I could have conversed with those who had come from thence, and had
brought four hatchets as a present. You would have seen a description of these things
in my Journal, if the success which had accompanied me during the voyage had not failed
me a quarter of an hour before arriving at the place from which I had departed. I had
escaped the dangers from savages, I had passed forty-two rapids, and was about to land
with complete joy at the success of so long and difficult an enterprise, when, after all
dangers seemed past, my canoe turned over. I lost two men and my box in sight of
the first French settlement, which I had left almost two years before. Nothing remains
to me but my life, and the wish to employ it in any service you may please.” This Report
was sent to France in November, 1674.</p>

<p>There is in Mr. Barlow’s Collection a large map (27 × 40 inches), which is held by
Dr. Shea and General Clarke to be a copy of the original Joliet Map, with the Ohio
marked in by a later and less skilful hand. A sketch of it is annexed as “Joliet’s
Larger Map.”</p>

<p>A copy of what is known as “Joliet’s Smaller Map” is also in the Barlow Collection,
and from it the annexed sketch has been made. This map is called <i>Carte de la descouverte
du S<sup>r</sup> Jolliet, ou l’on voit la communication du Fleuve St. Laurens avec les Lacs Frontenac,
Erie, Lac des Hurons, et Illinois ... au bout duquel on va joindre la Rivière divine
par un portage de mille pas qui tombe dans la Rivière Colbert et se descharge dans le Sein
Mexique</i>. Though evidently founded in part on the Jesuits’ map of Lake Superior, it was
an improvement upon it, and was inscribed with a letter addressed to Frontenac. The
Valley of the Mississippi is called <i>Colbertie</i>; the Ohio is marked as the course of La
Salle’s route to the Gulf;<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> the Wisconsin is made the route of Joliet.</p>

<p>Mr. Parkman describes another map, anonymous, but “indicating a greatly increased
knowledge of the country.” It marks the Ohio as a river descended by La Salle, but it
does not give the Mississippi.<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> Harrisse found in the Archives of the Marine a map
which he thought to be a part of the same described by Parkman, and this was made by
Joliet himself later than 1674.</p>

<p>There is in the Parkman Collection another map ascribed to Joliet, and called in the
sketch given herewith “Joliet’s carte générale,” which Parkman thinks was an early
work (in the drafting, at least) of the engineer Franquelin. It is signed <i>Johannes Ludovicus
Franquelin pinxit</i>; but it is a question what this implies. Harrisse<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> thinks that
Franquelin is the author, and places it under 1681. Gravier holds it to imply simply
Franquelin’s drafting, and affirms that it corresponds closely with a map signed by Joliet,
which has already been mentioned as his earliest. Mr. Neill says of this map that
it “is the first attempt to fix the position of the nations north of the Wisconsin and west
of Lake Superior. The Wisconsin is called Miskous, perhaps intended for Miskons;
and the Ohio is marked ‘Ouaboustikou.’ On the upper Mississippi are the names
of the following tribes: The ‘Siou,’ around what is now called the Mille Lacs region,
the original home of the Sioux of the Lakes, or Eastern Sioux; the Ihanctoua, Pintoüa,
Napapatou, Ouapikouti, Chaiena, Agatomitou, Ousilloua, Alimouspigoiak. The Ihanctoua
and Ouapikouti are two divisions of the Sioux, now known as Yanktons and Wahpekootays.
The Chaiena were allies of the Sioux, and hunted at that time in the valley of
the Red River of the North. The word in the Sioux means ‘people of another language,’
and the <i>voyageurs</i> called them Cheyennes.”</p>

<p>Something now needs to be said regarding Marquette’s contribution to our knowledge
of this expedition of 1673. He seems to have prepared from memory a narrative for
Frontenac, which is printed in two different forms in Margry.<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> Dablon used this account

prepared another copy, which was, with the original map, confided finally to the Archives
of the Collége Ste. Marie at Montreal, where Shea found it, and translated it for his
<i>Discovery of the Mississippi</i>,<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> in 1853, giving with it a fac-simile of the map.<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Neill, in comparing this map with the earliest of Joliet’s, as reproduced by Gravier
says: “Joliet marks the large island toward the extremity of Lake Superior known as Isle
Royale; but he gives no name, and he indicates four other islands on the north shore.”</p>

<p>The Jesuits about this time made a map, which, from having been given in Thevenot
as Marquette’s, passed as the work of that missionary till Shea found the genuine one in
Canada. What was apparently the
original of this in Thevenot is a manuscript
which Harrisse<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> says was formerly
in the Bibliothèque Nationale
at Paris, but cannot now be found.
Mr. Parkman has a copy of it, and
calls it “so crude and careless, and
based on information so inexact, that
it is of little interest.”<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Marquette’s later history is but brief. In the autumn of the
next year (1674) he started to found a mission among the Illinois;
but being detained by illness near Chicago, he did not reach the
Indian town of Kaskaskia till the spring of 1675. His strength
was ebbing, and he started with his companions to return to
St. Ignace, but had only reached a point on the easterly shore
of Lake Michigan, when he died, and his companions buried
him beside their temporary hut. The next year some Ottawas
who had been of his flock unearthed the bones and carried them
to Michillimackinac, where they were buried beneath the floor of
the little mission chapel.<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a></p>

faire leurs adorations.” The other longer legends are: 1. “Nations qui ont des chevaux et des chameaux.” 2. “On est venu jusques icy a la hauteur de
33 deg.” 3. “Monsoupena, ils ont des fusila.” It will be seen that the return route of Marquette and Joliet is incorrectly laid down. Parkman’s <i>La Salle</i>, p. 65.</p>

<p>Thirty years ago there were statements made by M. Noiseux, late vicar-general of
Quebec, to the effect that Marquette was not the first priest to visit the Illinois; but the
matter was set at rest by Dr. Shea.<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> A renewed interest came in 1873 with the bicentennial
of the discovery. Dr. Shea delivered an address on the occasion of the celebration,<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a>

     <div class="cf"><p class="pc250">FORT FRONTENAC.</p>
          <p class="pf250">This sketch follows a plan sent by Denonville
in 1685 to Paris, which is engraved in Faillon,
<i>Histoire de la Colonie Française</i>, iii. 467. The

papers are given in Margry (i. 291).</p>
</div></div>

<p>New complications were
now forming. The new governor,
Frontenac, was needy
in purse, expedient in devices,
and on terms of confidence
with a man destined to gain
a name in this western discovery.<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a>
This was La Salle.
Parkman pictures him with
having a certain robust ambition
to conquer the great
valley for France and himself,
and to outdo the Jesuits.
Shea sees in him little of the
hero, and few traces of a powerful
purpose.<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> Whatever his
character, he was soon embarked
with Frontenac on a
far-reaching scheme. It has
been explained in the preceding
chapter how the erection
of a fort had been begun by
Frontenac near the present town of Kingston on Lake Ontario. By means of such a
post he hoped to intercept the trafficking of the Dutch and English, and turn an uninterrupted
peltry trade to the French. The Jesuits at least neglected the scheme, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
neither Frontenac nor La Salle cared much for them.<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> Fort Frontenac was the first stage
in La Salle’s westward progress, and he was politic enough to espouse the Governor’s side
in all things when disputes occasionally ran high. His becoming the proprietor of the
seigniory, which included the new fort, meant the exclusion of others from the trade
in furs, and such exclusion made enemies of the merchants. It meant also colonization
and settlements; and that interfered with the labors of the Jesuits among the savages, and
made them look to the great western valley, of which so much had been said; but La Salle
was looking there too.<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a></p>

<p>In the first place he had strengthened his fort. He had pulled down the wooden structure,
and built another of stones and palisades, of which a plan is preserved to us. He
had drawn communities of French and natives about him, and maintained a mission, with
which Louis Hennepin was connected. We have seen how in the autumn of 1677<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> he
went once more to France, securing the right of seigniory over other posts as he might
establish them south and west during the next five years. This was by a patent dated at
St. Germain-en-Laye, May 12, 1678.<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> With dreams of Mexico and of a clime sunnier than
that of Canada, La Salle returned to Quebec to make new leagues with the merchants, and
to listen to Hennepin, who had come down from Fort Frontenac to meet him.<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> Mr.
Neill (in the previous chapter) has followed his fortunes from this point, and we have
seen him laying the keel of a vessel above the cataract.<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a></p>

<p>While this was going on La Salle returned below the Falls, and having begun two
blockhouses on the site of the later Fort Niagara,<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> proceeded to Fort Frontenac. By
spring Tonty had the “Griffin” ready for launching. She was of forty-five or fifty tons,
and when she had her equipment on board, five cannon looked from her port-holes. The
builders made all ready for a voyage in her, but grew weary in waiting for La Salle, who
did not return till August, when he brought with him Membré the priest, whose Journal
we are to depend on later, and the vessel departed on the voyage which Mr. Neill has
sketched.<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a></p>

<p>After the “Griffin” had departed homeward from this region, La Salle and his canoes
followed up the western shores of the lake, while Tonty and another party took the eastern.
The two finally met at the Miamis, or St. Joseph River, near the southeastern
corner of Lake Michigan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>They now together went up the St. Joseph, and crossing the portage<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> launched their
canoes on the Kankakee, an upper tributary of the Illinois River, and passed on to the
great town of the tribe of that name, where Marquette had been before them, near the
present town of Utica.<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> They found the place deserted, for the people were on their
winter hunt. They discovered, however, pits of corn, and got much-needed food. Passing
on, a little distance below Peoria Lake they came upon some inhabited wigwams.
Among these people La Salle learned how his enemies in Canada were inciting them to
thwart his progress; and there were those under this incitement who pictured so vividly
the terrors of the southern regions, that several of La Salle’s men deserted.</p>

<p>In January (1680) La Salle began a fortified camp near at hand, and called it Fort
Crèvecœur,<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> and soon after he was at work building another vessel of forty tons. He also
sent off Michel Accau, or Accault, and Hennepin on the expedition, of which some account
is given by Mr. Neill, and also by the Editor in a subsequent note. Leaving Tonty
in command of the fort, La Salle, in March, started to return to Fort Frontenac, his object
being to get equipments for his vessel; for he had by this time made up his mind that
nothing more would be seen of the “Griffin” and her return lading of anchors and supplies.
For sixty-five days he coursed a wild country and braved floods. He made, however,
the passage of a thousand miles in safety to Fort Frontenac, only to become aware
of the disastrous state of his affairs,&mdash;the loss of supplies.<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> A little later the same sort
of news followed him from Tonty, whose men had mutinied and scattered. His first
thought was to succor Tonty and the faithful few who remained with him; and accordingly
he started again for the Illinois country, which he found desolate and terrible with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
the devastations of the Iroquois. He passed the ruins of Crèvecœur, and went even to
the mouth of the Illinois; and under these distressing circumstances he saw the Mississippi
for the first time. Then he retraced his way, and was once again at Fort Miami. Not a
sign had been seen of Tonty, who had escaped from the feud of the Iroquois and Illinois,
not knowing which side to trust, and had made his way down the western side of Lake
Michigan toward Green Bay.</p>

<p>La Salle meanwhile at Fort Miami was making new plans and resolutions. He had an
idea of banding together under his leadership all the western tribes, and by this means to
keep the Iroquois in check while he perfected his explorations southward. So in the
spring (1681) he returned to the Illinois country to try to form the league; and while there
first heard from some wandering Outagamies of the safe arrival of Tonty at Green Bay,
and of the passage through that region of Hennepin eastward. Among the Illinois and
on the St. Joseph he was listened to, and everything promised well for his intended league.
In May he went to Michillimackinac, where he found Tonty and Membré, and with them
he proceeded to Fort Frontenac. Here once more his address got him new supplies, and
in the autumn (1681) he was again on his westward way. In the latter part of December,
with a company of fifty-four souls,&mdash;French and savage, including some squaws,&mdash;he
crossed the Chicago portage; and sledding and floating down the Illinois, on the 6th of
February he and his companions glided out upon the Mississippi among cakes of swimming
ice. On they went.<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> Stopping at one of the Chickasaw bluffs, they built a small stockade
and called it after Prudhomme, who was left in charge of it. Again they stopped for a
conference of three days with a band of Indians near the mouth of the Arkansas, where,
on the 14th of March, in due form, La Salle took possession of the neighboring country in
the name of his King.<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> On still they went, stopping at various villages and towns, securing
a welcome by the peace-pipe, and erecting crosses bearing the arms of France in the
open squares of the Indian settlements. On the 6th of April La Salle divided his party into
three, and each took one of the three arms which led to the Gulf. On the 9th they reunited,
and erecting a column just within one of the mouths of the river, La Salle formally
took possession of the great Mississippi basin in the name of the French monarch, whom
he commemorated in applying the name of Louisiana to the valley.<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a></p>

<p>Up the stream their canoes were now turned. On reaching Fort Prudhomme La Salle
was prostrated with a fever. Here he stayed, nursed by Membré,<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> while Tonty went on to
carry the news of their success to Michillimackinac, whence to despatch messengers to
the lower settlements. At St. Ignace La Salle joined his lieutenant.</p>

<p class="p2">For the events of these two years we have two main sources of information. First,
the “Relation de la descouverte de l’embouchure de la Rivière Mississipi dans le Golfe
de Mexique, faite par le Sieur de la Salle, l’année passée, 1682,” which was first published
by Thomassy;<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> the original is preserved in the Archives Scientifiques de la Marine, and
though written in the third person it is held to constitute La Salle’s Official Report, though
perhaps written for him by Membré.<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> Second, the narrative ascribed to Membré which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
is printed in Le Clercq’s <i>Établissement de la Foi</i>, ii. 214, and which seems to be based on
the document already named.<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a></p>

<p>In addition to this there is the paper of Nicolas de la Salle (no kinsman of the explorer),
who wrote for Iberville’s guidance, in 1699, his <i>Récit de la découverte que M. de la
Salle a faite de la Rivière de Mississipi en 1682</i>.<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a></p>

<p class="p2">La Salle’s future plans were now clearly fixed in his own mind, which were to reach
from Europe the Mississippi by sea, and to make it the avenue of approach to the destined
colonies, which he now sent Tonty to establish on the Illinois. With as little delay as possible,
he went himself to join his deputy. In December they selected the level summit of
the scarped rock (Starved Rock), on the river near the great Illinois town, and there
intrenched themselves, calling their fort “St. Louis.” Around it were the villages and
lodges of near twenty thousand savages, including, it is estimated, about four thousand
warriors. To this projected colony La Salle was under the necessity of trying to bring
his supplies from Canada till the route by the Gulf could be secured,&mdash;that Canada in
which he had many enemies, and whose new governor, De la Barre, was hostile to him,
writing letters of disparagement respecting him to the Court in Paris,<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> and seizing his
seigniory at Fort Frontenac on shallow pretexts. Thwarted in all efforts for succor from
below, La Salle left Tonty in charge of the new fort,<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> and started for Quebec, meeting on
the way an officer sent to supersede him in command. From Quebec La Salle sailed for
France.<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a></p>

<p>At this time the young French engineer, Franquelin, was in Quebec making record as
best he could, from such information as reached headquarters, of the progress of the
various discoverers. There are maps of his as early as 1679 and 1681 which are enumerated
by Harrisse.<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> Parkman is also inclined to ascribe to Franquelin a map with neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
date nor author, but of superior skill in drafting, which is called <i>Carte de l’Amérique
septentrionale et partie de la meridionale ... avec les nouvelles decouvertes de la Rivière
Mississipi, ou Colbert</i>. It records an event of 1679 in a legend, and omits the lower Mississippi;
which would indicate that the record was made before the results of La Salle’s
explorations were known.<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> A sketch of the Map of 1682 is given herewith from a copy in

<p>From La Salle, on his arrival in Quebec late in 1683, Franquelin undoubtedly got new
and trustworthy information of that explorer’s expedition down the Mississippi; and this
he embodied in what is usually known as Franquelin’s Great Map of 1684. It professed to
have been made in Paris, and as Franquelin was not in that city in 1684, Harrisse contends
that it was the work of De la Croix upon Franquelin’s material. It is called <i>Carte
de la Louisiane, ou des voyages du Sieur de la Salle et des pays qu’il a découverts depuis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
la Nouvelle-France jusqu’au Golfe de Mexique, les années 1679-80-81 et 82, par Jean-Baptiste
Louis Franquelin, l’an 1684, Paris</i>. It was formerly in the Archives du Dépôt de
la Marine; but Harrisse<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> reports it as missing from that repository, and describes it from
the accounts given by Parkman and by Thomassy.<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> A manuscript copy of this map was
made for Mr. Parkman, which is now in Harvard College Library, and from this copy
another copy was made in 1856, which is now in the Library of Parliament at Ottawa.
Mr. Parkman’s copy has been used in the annexed sketch.</p>

<p>Harrisse says that De la Croix made the <i>Carte de l’Amérique septent<sup>le</sup></i>,<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> which also purports
to be Franquelin’s, and shows the observations of “douze années.” Harrisse
places this map also in 1684, for the reason that a third map by Franquelin, <i>Carte de la
Amérique septentrionale</i>,<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> is dated 1688, and claims to embody the observations of “plus
de 16 années,” giving names and legends not in the earlier ones.<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a></p>

<p>“It indicates,” says Mr. Neill, “the post which had been recently established by Du
Lhut near the lower extremity of Lake Huron, and gives the present name, Manitoulin,
to the large island of Lake Huron, and marks on the west shore a Baye de Saginnam. It
places the mission on the south shore of Sault Ste. Marie, and names the rivers and points
on the north and south shores of Lake Superior. A stream near the present northern
boundary-line of the United States is called ‘R. des Grossillers,’ after the first explorer of
Minnesota. The river entering Lake Superior at the present Fort William is ‘Kamanistigouian,
ou Les Trois Rivières.’ Isle Royale is called ‘Minong;’ upon the northeast
part of ‘Lac Alepimigon’ is Du Lhut’s post, ‘Fort La Tourette.’ At the portage between
the sources of the St. Croix and a stream entering Lake Superior is ‘Fort St. Croix,’
which Bellin says was afterward abandoned. The St. Croix River is called ‘R. de la
Magdelaine.’ At the lower extremity of Lake Pepin is ‘Fort St. Antoine;’ and the site
of the present town of Prairie du Chien, near the mouth of the Wisconsin, appears as
‘Fort St. Nicolas,’ named in compliment to the baptismal name of Perrot. The Minnesota
River is marked ‘Les Mascoutens Nadouescioux,’ indicating that it ran through the
country of the Prairie Sioux. After Pierre Le Sueur had explored this river, De l’Isle, in
his map of 1703, gives it the name of St. Pierre, as it is supposed in compliment to Le
Sueur.”</p>

<p>A map of the next year (1689), also in the Archives, claims to be based on “Mémoires
et relations qu’il a eu soin de recueillir pendant pres de 17 années.” Harrisse thinks this
also a copy by De la Croix, and notes others of the probable dates of 1692 and 1699 respectively.<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a>
Harrisse also records<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> a manuscript map, “composée, corrigée, et augmentée
sur les journaux, mémoires, et observations les plus justes qui en ont été f<sup>tes</sup>. en l’année
1685 et 1686,” which is also preserved in the French Archives; and a <i>Carte Gēralle du
voyage que Mons<sup>r</sup> De Meulles ... a fait; ... commencé le 9<sup>e</sup> Novembre et finy le
6<sup>e</sup> Juillet, 1686</i>,<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> which was dedicated to Seignelay in the same year.</p>

<p>Parkman<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> says of the maps of Franquelin subsequent to his Great Map of 1684, that
they all have more or less of its features, but that the 1684 map surpasses them all in
interest and completeness.</p>

<p class="p2">It is convenient to complete here this enumeration of the maps of the western lakes
and the Mississippi basin before we turn to La Salle’s explorations from the Gulf side.</p>

<p>One of the earliest of the printed maps is that called <i>Partie occidentale du Canada, ou

<p>The routes of several of the early explorers, like those of Du Lhut, Joliet, and Marquette
(1672), and La Salle (1679-1680), are laid down on a manuscript map, <i>Carte des

the Connecticut and the Hudson. Lake Erie is a squarish oblong, larger than Ontario,
and of a shape rarely found in these early maps. In the upper lakes it resembles the map
of 1672-1673, which Harrisse<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> also found missing from the Bibliothèque Nationale.</p>

<p>La Salle once in Paris (1684) succeeded in obtaining an interview with the King, to
whom he then and subsequently in Memorials,<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a> which have been saved to us, presented an
ambitious scheme of fortifying the Mississippi near its mouths, and of subjugating the
neighboring Spanish colonies, of whose propinquity he had very confused notions, as
Franquelin’s map showed.</p>

<p>Peñalosa was at the same time pressing on the Court a plan
for establishing a French colony at the mouth of the Rio Bravo. La Salle’s personal
address, too, turned the scales against La

<p>Accordingly, La Forest, the rejected
commander of Fort Frontenac, was sent back
to Canada with letters from the King commanding
the Governor to make restitution
to La Salle’s lieutenant both of Fort Frontenac
and of Fort St. Louis. La Salle’s shining
promises so affected Louis, that the King gave him more vessels than he asked for;
and of these one, the “Joly,” carried thirty-six guns, and another six.<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> Among his company
were his brother Cavelier and two other Sulpitian

<p>A captain of the royal navy, Beaujeu,
was detailed to navigate the “Joly,” but under
the direction of La Salle, who was to be supreme. La Salle’s distrust and vacillation,
and Beaujeu’s jealousy and assumptions boded no good, and a dozen warm quarrels
between them were patched up before they got to sea.<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a></p>

also a great deal to do.” This follows the Barlow
original. There is in the Parkman Collection
a copy of a part of it by Harrisse.</p>

<p>There was not a little in all
this to point to a state of mental unsoundness in La Salle. At a late day Joutel, a fellow-townsman
of La Salle, destined to become the expedition’s historian, joined the fleet at
Rochelle, and on the 24th of July (1684) it sailed, only to put back, four days later, to
repair a broken bowsprit of the “Joly.” Once again they put to sea.</p>

<p>Everything still
went wrong. The leaders chafed and quarrelled as on land.<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> The Spaniards captured
their smallest vessel.<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> At Santo Domingo the Governor of the island and his officers
joined in the quarrel on the side of La Salle, who now fell prostrate with disease. When
he recovered he set sail again with his three remaining ships on the 25th of November,
coasted the southern shore of Cuba, and on New Year’s Day (1685) sighted land somewhere
near the River Sabine. He supposed himself east of the Mississippi mouths, when
in fact he was far to the west of them. He knew their latitude, for he had taken the sun
when there on his canoe voyage in 1682; but he had at that time no means of ascertaining
their longitude. The “Joly” next disappeared in a fog, and La Salle waited for
her four or five days, but in vain. So he sailed on farther till he found the coast trending
southerly, when he turned, and shortly after met the “Joly.” Passages of crimination
and recrimination between the leaders of course followed.<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> La Salle all the while was
trying to make out that the numerous lagoons along the coast were somehow connected
with the mouths of the Mississippi, while Beaujeu, vexed at the confusion and indecision
of La Salle’s mind, did little to make matters clearer. They were in reality at Matagorda
Bay. Trying to make an anchorage within, one of the vessels struck a reef and became
a total wreck, and only a small part of her cargo was saved.<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> La Salle suspected it
was done to embarrass him; and landing his men, he barricaded himself on the unhealthy
ground, amid a confusion of camp equipage, including what was saved from the
wreck. A swarm of squalid savages looked on, and saw a half-dozen of the Frenchmen
buried daily. The Indians contrived to pilfer some blankets, and when a force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
was sent to punish them they killed several of the French. Beaujeu offered some good
advice, but La Salle rejected it; and finally, on the 12th of March the “Joly” sailed, and
La Salle was left with his forlorn colony.<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> Beaujeu steered, as he thought, for the Baye
du St. Esprit (Mobile Bay [?]); but his belief that he was leaving the mouths of the Mississippi
made him miss that harbor, and after various adventures he bore away for France,
and reached Rochelle about the 1st of July. With him returned the engineer, Minet, who
made on the voyage a map of the mouths of the Mississippi doubly interpreted,&mdash;one
sketch being based on the Franquelin map of 1684, as La Salle had found it in 1682;
and the other conformed to their recent observations about Matagorda, into whose lagoons
he made this great river discharge.<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a></p>

<p>It soon dawned upon La Salle that he was not at the Mississippi delta; and it was imperative
that he should establish a base for future movements. So he projected a settlement
on the Lavaca River, which flowed into the head of the bay; and thither all went,
and essayed the rough beginnings of a post, which he called Fort St. Louis.<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> He was also
constrained to lay out a graveyard, which received its tenants rapidly. As soon as housing
and stockades were finished, La Salle, on the last day of October (1685), leaving Joutel in
command, started with fifty men to search for the Mississippi.</p>

<p>The first tidings Joutel got of his absent chief was in January (1686), when a straggler
from La Salle’s party appeared, and told a woeful story of his mishaps. By the end of
March La Salle himself returned with some of his companions; others he had left in a
palisaded fort which he had built on a great river somewhere away. While on his return
he detached some of his men to find his little frigate, the “Belle,” which he had left
at a certain place on the coast. These men also soon appeared, but they brought no
tidings of the vessel. The loss of her and of what she had on board made matters
very desperate, and La Salle determined on another expedition, this time to the Illinois
country and to Canada, whence he could send word to France for succor. On the 22d
of April they started,&mdash;La Salle, his brother Cavelier, the Friar Douay, and a score or
so others.</p>

<p>Joutel was still left in command; and a few days later the appearance of six men, who
alone had been saved from the wreck of the “Belle,” and reached the fort, confirmed the
worst fears of that vessel’s fate. Meanwhile La Salle was experiencing dangers and evils of
all kinds,&mdash;the desertion and death of his men, and delays by sickness, and the spending
of ammunition. Once again there was nothing for him to do but to return to Joutel, and
so with eight out of his twenty men he came back to the fort. The colony had dwindled
from one hundred and eighty to forty-five souls, and another attempt to secure succor
was imperative. So in January (1687) a new cheerless party set out, Joutel this time accompanying
La Salle; and with the rest were Duhaut, a sinister man, and Liotot the
surgeon. For two months it was the same story of suffering on the march and of danger
in the camp. Then quarrels ensued; and the murder of La Salle’s nephew and two others
who were devoted to him compelled the assassins to save themselves by killing La Salle
himself; and from an ambuscade Duhaut and Liotot shot their chief. The party now succumbed
to the rule of Duhaut. They ranged aimlessly among the Indians for a while, and
fell in with some deserters of La Salle’s former expedition now living among the savages.
One of these conspired with Hiens, one of those privy to La Salle’s death, and killed the
assassins Duhaut and Liotot. Joutel with the few who were left now parted amicably
with Hiens and the savage Frenchmen, and pushed their way to find the Great River. At
a point on the Arkansas not far from its confluence with the Mississippi, they were
rejoiced to find the abode of two of Tonty’s men. This sturdy adherent of La Salle’s fortunes
had been reinstated, as we have seen, by the King’s order, in the command of the
fortified rock on the Illinois, and had in due time, after the return of Beaujeu to Rochelle,
got the news of La Salle’s landing on the Gulf. In February, 1686, he had started down
the river with a band of French and Indians to join his old commander. He reached the
Gulf,<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> but of course failed to find La Salle; and returning, had left several men in the
villages of the Arkansas, of whom Couture and another now welcomed Joutel and his
weary companions. After some delay the wanderers floated their wooden canoe down
the Arkansas, and then began their weary journey up the Great River, and by the middle
of September they reached the Fort St. Louis of the Illinois. They found Tonty absent,
and Bellefontaine in command. They foolishly thought to increase their welcome by presenting
themselves as the forerunners of La Salle, who was on the way,&mdash;tidings which
kept all in good spirits except the Jesuit Allouez, who happened to be in the fort, and was
ill, for he was conscious of his machinations against La Salle, and dreaded to encounter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
him.<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> Cavelier and Joutel soon started for the Chicago portage. A storm on the lake
impeded them subsequently, and they came back to the fort to find Tonty returned from
Denonville’s campaign against the Senecas.<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> The same deceit regarding La Salle’s fate
was practised on Tonty, and he gave them money and supplies as to La Salle’s representatives,
only to learn a few months later, when Couture came up from the Arkansas,
of La Salle’s murder. The wanderers, however, had now passed on, had reached Quebec
in safety, still concealing what they knew, and not disclosing it till they reached France;
and even in France there is a suspicion that Cavelier held his peace till he had secured
some property against the seizure of La Salle’s creditors. Why Joutel connived at the
deception is less comprehensible, for otherwise he bears a fair name. No representations
of his, however, could induce the King to send succor to the hapless colony; and all the
result, so far as known, of the tardy acknowledgment of La Salle’s death was an order
sent to Canada for the arrest of his murderers.</p>

<p>The story which Couture told to Tonty in September inspired that hero with a determination
to try to rescue La Salle’s colony on the Gulf. So in December he left his
fortified rock, with five Frenchmen and three others. Late in March he was on the Red
River, where all but two of his companions deserted him. He was himself finally, by the
loss of his ammunition, compelled to turn back, but not till he had learned of the probable
death of Heins.<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> In September he reached his fort on the Illinois; and here, with La
Forest, he continued to live, holding the seigniory jointly under a royal patent, and trading
in furs, till 1702, when the establishment was broken up.<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> Tonty now joined D’Iberville
in Louisiana, and of his subsequent years nothing is known. The French again occupied
his rocky fastness; but when Charlevoix saw it, in 1721, it was only a ruin.</p>

<p>The fate of the Texan colony is soon told. The Spaniards who had searched for
it by sea had always missed it, though they had found the wrecked vessels.<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> A Frenchman,
probably a deserter from La Salle, fell into the Spaniards’ hands in New Leon.
From him they learned its position, and despatched under the Frenchman’s guidance
a force to capture it. They found the fort deserted, and three dead bodies a little distance
off. From the Indians they learned of two Frenchmen who were living with a
distant tribe. They sent for them under a pledge of good treatment; and when they
came, they proved to be L’Archevêque, one of Duhaut’s accomplices, and one of the stray
deserters whom Joutel had discovered after the murder. They told a story of ravages
from the small-pox and of slaughter by the savages. A few of the colonists had been
saved by the Indian women; but these were subsequently given up to the Spaniards, and
they added their testimony to the sad and ignominious end of the colony.</p>

<p class="p2">It is necessary to define the historical sources regarding this hapless Texan expedition,
about the purpose of which there have been some diverse views lately expressed.
It is clear that under cover of a grand plan of Spanish conquest, La Salle had dazed
the imagination of the King in memorials,<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> which may possibly have been only meant to
induce the royal espousal of his more personal schemes. Shea contends that La Salle’s
real object was not to settle in Louisiana, but to conquer Santa Barbara and the mining
regions in Mexico, and to pave the way for Peñalosa’s expedition.<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>For the broader relations of the expedition to the earlier explorations of 1682, we must
go to a source of the first importance preserved in the Archives of the Marine. It is
entitled <i>Mémoire envoyé en 1693 sur la découverte du Mississipi et des nations voisines
par le Sieur de la Salle, en 1678, et depuis sa mort par le Sieur de Tonty</i>, and is printed
by Margry;<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> and Parkman calls it excellent authority. Out of this and an earlier paper,
written in Quebec in 1684,<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a> a book, disowned by Tonty, as Charlevoix tells us, was in part
fabricated, and appeared at Paris in 1697 under the title of <i>Dernières découvertes dans
l’Amérique septentrionale de M. de la Salle, mises au jour par M. le Chevalier Tonti,
gouverneur du Fort St. Louis, aux Islinois</i>.<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> Parkman<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> calls it “a compilation full
of errors,” and does not rely upon it. Shea says of it that, “although repudiated by Tonti,
it must have been based on papers of his.” It has been held apocryphal by Iberville and
Margry; but Falconer, La Harpe, Boimare, and Gravier put trust in it.</p>

<p>It is thought that a Journal by Joutel was written in part to counteract the statements
of the <i>Dernières découvertes</i>. This Joutel paper was given first in full by Margry,<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> and
Parkman<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> says of it that it seems to be “the work of an honest and intelligent man.”<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a>
It was printed in Paris in 1713, but abridged and changed in a way which Joutel complained
of, and bore the title, <i>Journal historique du dernier voyage que feu M. de la Salle
fit dans le Golfe du Mexique, pour trouver l’embouchure du Mississipi. Par M. Joutel</i>.<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>To these there are various supplemental narratives, with their interest centring in the
death of La Salle.<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a> Joutel gives an account of the scene as he learned it at the time.<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a>
Tonty’s account was at second hand. Douay saw the deed, and what he reported is given
in Le Clercq’s <i>Établissement de la Foi</i>.<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> A document in the Archives of the Marine&mdash;<i>Relation
de la mort du Sr. de la Salle, suivant le rapport d’un nommé Couture, à qui M.
Cavelier l’apprit en passant au pays des Akansa</i>&mdash;is given by Margry;<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a> and Harrisse
thinks that it merits little confidence.</p>

<p>Cavelier is known to have made a report to Seignelay; and his rough draft of this
was recovered in 1854 by Parkman,<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> who calls it “confused and unsatisfactory in its
statements, and all the latter part has been lost,” the fragment closing several weeks
before the death of his brother.<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a></p>

<p>The character of Beaujeu has certainly been put in a more favorable light by the publication
of Margry, and the old belief in his treachery has been somewhat modified.<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a></p>

<p>The Spanish account of the fate of the colony is translated from Barcia’s <i>Ensayo
cronologico de la Florida</i>,<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> in Shea’s <i>Discovery of the Mississippi</i>;<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> and Margry<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a> adds
to our knowledge, as does Buckingham Smith in his <i>Coleccion</i>.<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a></p>

<p>It remains now to speak of the Collections which have been formed, and the theories
regarding these Western explorations which have been maintained, by M. Pierre Margry,
who has occupied till within a few years the office of archivist of the Marine and Colonies
in Paris, having been for a long period assistant and principal. Margry may be said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
to have discovered what that department contained in manuscripts relating to the explorations
of the Mississippi Valley and River, particularly as regards La Salle’s agency.
On more than one occasion he has done good service in helping to enrich the archives
of New York<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> and Canada with copies of documents known to him,&mdash;so far, apparently,
as they did not interfere with his own projects of publication. His position created relations
for him with other departments of the French Government, and his eager discernment
found an abundance of manuscript treasures even in private hands. These he
assiduously gathered, and on a few occasions he published papers<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> which seemed to
indicate more than he chose to disclose explicitly; for his fellow-students were not quite
satisfied, and longed for the documents which had yielded so much. As the guardian
of the public archives, he was by office the agent and servant of the public; but other
investigators, it is feared, failed, through obstacles thrown in their way, to profit as they
might by what that office contained. There is in the Sparks Collection of Manuscripts
in Harvard College Library a volume of copies of such documents as could be found
in the Paris Archives which that historian intended to use in another edition of his <i>Life
of La Salle</i>. While Mr. Sparks was regretting that not a single document or letter in
the hand of the great explorer had come down to us, enough to fill a large volume was
immured in these Paris Archives. At a later day Mr. Parkman, in turn, failed of access
to documents which were of the first importance to him, and he was obliged to make
the best use he could of what it was possible to obtain. Environed by these disadvantages
Mr. Parkman published, in 1869, his <i>Discovery of the Great West</i>. In his Preface,
speaking of the obscurity which had enshrouded the whole subject, he referred to the “indefatigable
research of M. Pierre Margry, Assistant-Custodian of the Archives of the
Marine and Colonies at Paris, whose labors as an investigator of the maritime and colonial
history of France can be appreciated only by those who have seen their results.”</p>

<p>Gravier about the same time referred to the twenty years of study which had made
M. Margry the most learned of students of La Salle’s history.</p>

<p>It was evident that investigators could not profit by this accumulation of material,
unless M. Margry’s hopes of publication were realized. He refused offers to purchase.
In conjunction with M. Harrisse, an effort was made by him in 1870-1871 to enlist the aid
of the United States Congress; but a vote which passed the Senate failed in the House.
The great fire at Boston in 1872 stayed the progress which, under Mr. Parkman’s instigation,
had been made to insure a private publication. At last, by Mr. Parkman’s assiduous
labors in the East, and by those of Colonel Whittlesey, Mr. O. H. Marshall, and others
in the West, and with the active sympathy of the Hon. George F. Hoar, a bill was passed
Congress in 1873, making a subscription for five hundred copies of the intended work.<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a></p>

<p>With this guaranty M. Margry put to press the series of volumes entitled <i>Mémoires
et documents pour servir à l’histoire des origines Françaises de pays d’outre-mer:
découvertes et établissements des Français dans l’ouest et dans le sud d’Amérique septentrionale</i>.
The first volume appeared in 1876. It contained an Introduction by M.
Margry, and was prefixed by a very questionable likeness of La Salle,&mdash;the picture (of
which nothing was said by the editor) having no better foundation than the improbable
figure of the explorer in a copperplate, published some years after his death, representing
the scene of his murder, and of which a fac-simile is annexed.<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> Of the intended volumes,
three are devoted to La Salle, and appeared between 1876 and 1878: vol. i., <i>Voyages des<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
Français sur les grands lacs, et découvertes de l’Ohio et du Mississippi</i>, 1614-1684; vol. ii.,
<i>Lettres de La Salle, et correspondance relative à ses entreprises</i>, 1678-1685 (these include
letters also preserved in the Bibliothèque Nationale); vol. iii., <i>Recherche des bouches du
Mississipi et voyage à travers le continent depuis les côtes du Texas jusqu’à Québec</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

         title="" />
</div>

<p>The later volumes (the Editor has seen in Mr. Parkman’s hands the proofs of vols. iv.
and v., and there is to be one more) pertain to Iberville and the following century; but a
volume of the early cartography is promised as a completion of the publication. On the
issue of these three volumes Mr. Parkman in considerable part rewrote his <i>Discovery of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
the Great West</i>, and republished it in 1879 as <i>La Salle and the Discovery of the Great
West</i>. In his Preface he speaks of the collection of documents in Margry’s keeping
“to which he had not succeeded in gaining access,” and which, besides the papers in his
official charge, included others added by him from other public archives and from private
collections in France. “In the course of my inquiries,” says Mr. Parkman, “I owed
much to [M. Margry’s] friendly aid; but his collections as a whole remained inaccessible,
since he naturally wished to be the first to make known the results of his labors.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400">LA SALLE.</p>
        <p class="pf400">This follows a design given in Gravier
(pp. 1, 202), which is said to be based on an
engraving preserved in the Bibliothèque de
Rouen, entitled <span class="smcap">Cavilli de la Salle François</span>,&mdash;and
is the only picture meriting notice,
except possibly a small vignette of which Gravier
gives a fac-simile in his <i>Cavelier de la Salle</i>.
Mr. Parkman has a photograph, given to him by
Gravier, of a modern painting drawn from the
first of these two pictures. In the <i>Magazine
of American History</i>, May, 1882, there is an
engraving, “after a photograph of the original
painting,” leading the reader to suppose a
veritable original likeness to have been followed,
instead of this photograph of a made-up
picture.</p>
</div></div>

<p>It was fortunate that in regard to one point only this deprivation had led Mr. Parkman
astray in his earlier edition; and that was upon La Salle’s failure to find the mouth of the
Mississippi in 1684, and the conduct therewith of Beaujeu. Mr. Parkman has testified
to the authenticity of the La Salle letters in the <i>North American Review</i>, December,
1877, where (p. 428) he says: “The contents of these letters were in good measure
known through a long narrative compiled from them by one of the writer’s friends, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
took excellent care to put nothing into it which could compromise him. All personalities
are suppressed. These letters of La Salle have never been used by any historical writer.”
Margry’s publication has been reviewed by J. Thoulet in the <i>Bulletin de la Société de
Géographie</i>, November and December, 1880, where a modern map enables the reader to
track the explorer’s course. A sketch of this map is given on an earlier page.</p>

<p>The severest criticism of Margry’s publication has come from Dr. Shea, in a tract
entitled <i>The Bursting of Pierre Margry’s La Salle Bubble</i>, New York, 1879,&mdash;a paper
which first appeared in the <i>New York Freeman’s Journal</i>. Margry is judged by his
critic to have unwarrantably extended the collection by repeating what had already elsewhere
been printed, sometimes at greater length.<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> The “bubble” in question is the view
long entertained by Margry that La Salle was the real discoverer of the Mississippi, and
which he has set forth at different times in the following places:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. “Les Normands dans les vallées de l’Ohio et du Mississippi,” in the <i>Journal
general de l’instruction publique</i>, July-September, 1862, placing the event in 1670-1671.</p>

<p>Margry, who has wavered somewhat, first claimed that La Salle reached the Mississippi
by the Ohio in 1670; and later he has contended for the route by the Illinois in
1671. He bases his claim upon four grounds:&mdash;</p>

<p>First, upon a <i>Récit d’un ami de l’Abbé de Galinée</i>, 1666-1678 (printed in the <i>Découvertes</i>,
etc., i. 342, 378),<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> which is without date, but which Margry holds to be the work of Abbé
Renaudot, derived from La Salle in Paris in 1678, wherein it is stated that La Salle, after
parting with Dollier and Galinée, made a first expedition to the Ohio, and a second by
the Illinois to the Mississippi.</p>

<p>Second, upon a letter of La Salle’s niece, dated 1756 (i. 379), which affirms that the
writer of it possessed maps which had belonged to La Salle in 1676, and that such maps
showed that previous to that date he had made two voyages of discovery, and that upon
these maps the Colbert (Mississippi) is put down.</p>

<p>Third, upon a letter of Frontenac in 1677 to Colbert (i. 324), which places, as is
alleged, the voyage of Joliet after that of La Salle; but at the same time (ii. 285) he prints
a paper of La Salle virtually admitting Joliet’s priority.</p>

<p>Fourth, upon the general antagonism between the Jesuits, who espoused Joliet’s
claim, and the merchants, who were, with La Salle, the adherents of the Sulpitians
and Recollects.</p>

<p>Sides have been taken among scholars in regard to the irrefragability of these evidences,
but with a great preponderance of testimony against their validity.</p>

<p>The principal supporter of Margry’s view (though Henri Martin has adopted it) has
been Gabriel Gravier in the following publications:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>Découvertes et établissements de la Cavelier de la Salle de Rouen dans l’Amérique
du nord</i>, Paris, 1870.</p>

<p>2. <i>Cavelier de la Salle de Rouen</i>, Paris, 1871, p. 23. This work is in good part a
commentary on Parkman, to whom it is dedicated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

1878, placing it in 1666.</p>

<p>4. In <i>Magazine of American History</i>, viii. 305 (May, 1882).</p>

claim for La Salle, are given in the following places, without enumerating Charlevoix,
Sparks, and the other upholders of the Joliet discovery, before Margry’s theory was

<h3><a name="c247" id="c247">FATHER LOUIS HENNEPIN</a></h3>

<p class="pc1 mid">AND HIS REAL OR DISPUTED DISCOVERIES.</p>

<p class="pc1">BY THE EDITOR.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE life of this Recollect missionary is
derived in its particulars mainly from his
own writings; and the details had never been
set forth in an orderly way till Dr. J. G. Shea
in 1880 prefixed to a new translation of Hennepin’s
first book a satisfactory sketch. He seems
to have been born in Hainault, though precisely
when does not appear. Felix Van Hulst, in the
title of his tract, gives the date approximately:
<i>Notice sur le Père Louis Hennepin, né à Ath</i> (<i>Belgique</i>)
<i>vers 1640</i>. Liege, 1845. He early joined
the Franciscans, served the Order in various
places, travelled as he could, was inspired with
a desire to see the world, and felt the impulse
strongest when, at Calais, he listened to the narratives
of sea-captains who had returned from
long voyages. This inclination prompted him
to continued missionary expeditions, and to attendance
upon armies in their campaigns. In
1675 Frontenac succeeded in his attempt to recall
to Canada the Recollects, as a foil to the
Jesuits; and among the first of that Order to
go was Hennepin, who crossed the ocean in the
same ship with La Salle, the ambitious explorer,
and De Laval, the new Bishop of Quebec. According
to his own account, Hennepin had his
first quarrel with La Salle about some girls who
were on their way to reinforce the family life of
the new colony.<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a></p>

<p>La Salle enjoyed their dances, and Hennepin,
as their spiritual guide, kept them under restraint.
This, at least, is the Recollect story of
the origin of La Salle’s enmity for the missionary.</p>

<p>From Quebec Hennepin continued his missionary
wanderings, sometimes to remote stations,
and at one time, in the spring of 1677,
among the Iroquois,&mdash;not going, however, to
Albany, as has been sometimes asserted. (Cf.
Brodhead’s <i>New York</i>, ii. 307; <i>Hist. Mag.</i> x. 268.)
Next he accompanied La Salle in his explorations
west. Of Niagara he offers us the earliest
picture in his 1697 publication,&mdash;of which
a reduced fac-simile is here given. Others are
in Gay’s <i>Pop. Hist. U. S.</i>, ii. 511; Shea’s <i>Hennepin</i>,
p. 379, and in his <i>Le Clercq</i>, ii. 112; and
in the <i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>, vol. ii. no. 561.
The original cut was repeated in the later
editions and translations of Hennepin. These
Falls had been indicated on Champlain’s map, in
1632, with the following note: “Sault d’eau au
bout du Sault [Lac] Sainct Louis fort hault, où
plusiers sortes de poissons descendans s’estourdissent.”
This was from the natives’ accounts.
Ragueneau, in the <i>Relation</i> of 1648, was the first
to describe them, though they had been known
by report to the Jesuits some years earlier (Parkman’s
<i>Jesuits</i>, p. 142). Lalemant, in 1641, called
them <i>Onguiaahra</i>. Ragueneau gave them no
definite altitude, but called them of “frightful
height.” Hennepin, in his 1683 book, calls them
five hundred feet, and in 1697 six hundred feet
high, and describes a side-shoot on their western
verge which does not now exist. Sanson, in his
map of 1657, had somewhat simplified Ragueneau’s
name into <i>Ongiara</i>; but Hennepin gives
the name in its present form. There is a great
variety in the early spelling of the name. (See
<i>Canadian Journal</i>, 1870, p. 385.) The word is of
Iroquois origin, and its proper phonetic spelling
is very like the form now in use (Parkman, <i>La
Salle</i>, p. 126; O’Callaghan, <i>Col. Doc., index</i>, 465).
Hennepin had also been anticipated in a brief
notice by Gendron, in his <i>Quelques Particularites</i>,
etc., 1659. Hennepin’s account is also translated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
in the <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, v. 47. His engraving
was reproduced, in 1702, in Campanius’
work on New Sweden.</p>

</div>

<p>Hennepin accompanied La Salle to the
point where Fort Crèvecœur was built, on the
Illinois, and parting from La Salle here in February,
1680, he pursued his further wandering
down the Illinois to the Mississippi, and thence
up to the Falls of St. Anthony, which were
named by him in reference to his being a Recollect
of the province of St. Anthony in Artois.
On the 3d of July, 1880, the bi-centenary of the
discovery of these Falls was observed, when
C. K. Davis delivered an historical address.
Thence, after being captured by the Sioux and
rescued by a party under Du Lhut,<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> Hennepin
made his way to the Wisconsin, passed by
Green Bay, and reached Quebec. He soon after
returned to France, where, on the 3d of September,
1682, he obtained the royal permission
to print his first book, which was issued from
the press Jan. 5, 1683.</p>

<p>From this point his story<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> can be best followed
in connection with the history of his
books, and as they are rare and curious, it has
been thought worth while to point out a few of
the repositories of copies, which are indicated
by the following heavy-faced letters:&mdash;</p>

<p>In this earliest work of Hennepin the Mississippi,
it will be seen by the map, forms no certain
connection with the Gulf of Mexico, but is
connected by a dotted line, and there is no
claim for explorations further south than the
map indicates. Hennepin’s later publications
have raised doubts as to the good faith of his
narrative of discoveries on the Upper Mississippi.
Harrisse (no. 150), for instance, says
“Cette <i>Relation</i> de 1683 n’est en réalité qu’une
pâle copie d’un des mémoires de Cavelier de
la Salle;” and goes on to deny to Hennepin the
priority of giving the name of Louisiana to the
country. La Salle and others of his contemporaries
threw out insinuations as to his veracity,
or at least cautioned others against his tendency
to exaggerate. (Cf. Neill, <i>Writings of Hennepin</i>.)
The publication of an anonymous account of
La Salle’s whole expedition in Margry’s <i>Découvertes
et Établissements des Français</i>, has enabled
Dr. Shea, in his edition of Hennepin, to contest
Margry’s views of Hennepin’s plagiarism, and
to compare the two narratives critically; and he
comes to the conclusion that probably Hennepin
was La Salle’s scribe before they parted,
and that he certainly contributed directly or
indirectly to La Salle’s despatches what pertains
to Hennepin’s subsequent independent exploration,&mdash;thus
making the borrowing to be on the
part of the anonymous writer, who, if he were
La Salle, did certainly no more than was becoming
in the master of the expedition to combine
the narratives of his subordinates. It is Shea’s
opinion, however, that the Margry document
was not written by La Salle, but by some compiler
in Paris, who used Hennepin’s printed
book rather than his notes or manuscript reports.
Margry claims that this <i>Relation officielle de
l’enterprise de La Salle, de 1678 à 1681</i>, was
compiled by Bernou for presentation to Colbert.
Parkman thinks, as opposed to Shea’s view,
that Hennepin knew of the document, and incorporated
many passages from it into his book (<i>La
Salle</i>, pp. 150, 262). Dr. Shea sided with the
detractors of Hennepin in his earlier <i>Discovery
of the Mississippi</i>; but in this later book he
makes fair amends for what he now considers
his hasty conclusions then. Cf. further Sparks’s
<i>Life of La Salle</i>, and the <i>North American Review</i>,
January, 1845. Mr. Parkman’s conclusion
is that this early book of Hennepin is “comparatively
truthful.”</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid"><b>II. NOUVELLE DÉCOUVERTE.</b></p>

<p class="p1">According to Hennepin’s own story, some
time after his first book was published, he incurred
the displeasure of the Provincial of his
Order by refusing to return to America, and was
in more ways than one so pursued by his superior
that in the end he threw himself on the
favor of William III. of England, whom he had
met at the Hague. Hennepin searched Amsterdam
for a publisher of his new venture, but had
to take it to Utrecht, where it came out, in 1697,
with a fulsome dedication to the English king.
It is called in the printed title (the engraved
title is abridged): <i>Nouvelle Découverte d’un très<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
grand Pays, situé dans l’Amérique, entre le Nouveau

<p>It will be observed that in both of the maps of
1697, extracts from which are given herewith,
the Mississippi River is marked as continuing
its course to the Gulf. This change is made to
illustrate an interpolation in the text (pp. 249-312),
borrowed from Father Membré’s Journal
of La Salle’s descent of the river, as given in
Le Clercq’s <i>Premier Établissement de la Foi</i>, p.
153. Sparks, in his <i>Life of La Salle</i>, was the
first to point out this correspondence. Mr.
J. H. Perkins, reviewing Sparks’s book in the
<i>North American Review</i> in January, 1839 (reprinted
in his <i>Memoir and Writings</i>, vol. ii.), on
the “Early French Travellers in the West,”
referring to the partial statements of the distrust
of Hennepin in Andrew Ellicott’s <i>Journal</i>,
and in Stoddard’s <i>Sketches of Louisiana</i>, makes,
for the first time, as he thinks, a thorough critical
statement of the grounds “for thinking the
<i>Reverend Father</i> so great a liar.” Further elucidation
of the supposed theft was made by Dr.
Shea in his <i>Discovery of the Mississippi</i>, etc., p.
105, where, p. 83, he translated for the first time
into English Membré’s Journal. The Membré
narrative is much the same as a <i>Relation de la
Découverte de l’Embouchure de la Rivière Mississippi,
faite par le Sieur de la Salle, l’année passée</i>,
1682, preserved in the Archives Scientifiques de
la Marine, and printed in Thomassy’s <i>Géologie
pratique de la Louisiane</i>. Gravier, p. 180, holds
it to be the work of La Salle himself (Boimare,
<i>Text explicatif pour accompagner la première
planche historique relative à la Louisiane</i>, Paris,
1868; cf. Gravier’s Appendix, no. viii). That
there was a fraud on Hennepin’s part has been
generally held ever since Sparks made his representations.
Bancroft calls Hennepin’s journal
“a lie.” Brodhead calls it an audacious
falsehood. Parkman (<i>La Salle</i>, p. 226) deems it
a fabrication, and has critically examined Hennepin’s
inconsistencies. Gravier classes his narrative
with Gulliver’s.</p>

<p>The excuse given in the <i>Nouvelle Découverte</i>
for the tardy appearance of this Journal is,
that fear of the hostility of La Salle having prevented
its appearance in the <i>Description de la
Louisiane</i>, that explorer’s death rendered the
suppression of it no longer necessary. It is,
moreover, proved that passages from Le Clercq
are also appropriated in describing the natives
and the capture of Quebec in 1628. The reply
to this was that Le Clercq stole from a copy of
Hennepin’s Journal, which had been lent to Le
Roux in Quebec. These revelations led Shea
seriously to question in his <i>Mississippi</i> if Hennepin
had ever seen the upper parts of that river,
and to suspect that Hennepin may have learned
what he wrote from Du Lhut. Harrisse, p. 176,
brings forward some new particulars about Hennepin’s
relations with Du Lhut.</p>

<p>Dr. Shea’s later views, as expressed in his
English translation (1880) of the <i>Description de
la Louisiane</i> (1683), is that Hennepin’s manuscript
or revamped copy of his earlier book, as
prepared for the printer by himself, was subjected
to the manipulations of an ignorant and
treacherous editor, who made these insertions
to produce a more salable book, and that Hennepin
was not responsible for it in the form in
which it appeared. Shea’s arguments to prove
this opposite of the generally received opinion
are based on inherent evidence in the insertions
that Hennepin could not have written them, and
on the material evidences of these questionable
portions of the book having been printed at a
later time than the rest of it, and in different
type. The only rejoinder yet made to this exculpation
is by Mr. E. D. Neill, in a tract on
<i>The Writings of Louis Hennepin</i>, read before the
Minnesota Historical Society in November, 1880,
in which the conclusion is reached that “nothing
has been discovered to change the verdict
of two centuries, that Louis Hennepin, Recollect
Franciscan, was deficient in Christian manhood.”</p>

an English translation issued under
the following title: <i>A new Discovery
of a Vast Country in America, extending
above four thousand miles
between New France and New Mexico</i>,
etc., London, 1698. It contains&mdash;part i.,
a translation of the
<i>Nouvelle Découverte</i>; part ii., in
smaller type and new paging, a
version of the <i>Nouveau Voyage</i>; the
rest of the volume in the type of
part i. and continuing its paging,
being an account of Marquette’s
voyages. Another edition of the
same year shows a slight change
of title, with alterations in part i.
and part ii. rewritten. Still another
issue conforms in title to the earliest,
but in body, with a slight
correction, to the second edition.

<h3><a name="c257" id="c257"></a>BARON LA HONTAN.</h3>

<p class="pc1 lmid">A BIBLIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL NOTE BY THE EDITOR.</p>

<p class="drop-cap18">LA HONTAN, a young Gascon, born about
1667, had come to Canada in 1683, and
from being a common soldier, had by his ability
risen to an officer’s position. He became a favorite
of Frontenac, and was selected by him to
bear the despatch to Paris which conveyed an
account of Phips’s failure before Quebec in 1690.
He was not long after made deputy-governor of
Placentia, where he quarrelled with his superior
and fled to France; and here, fearing arrest, he
was obliged to escape beyond its boundaries.
After the Peace of Ryswick he sought reinstatement,
but was not successful; and it is alleged
that his book, which he now published, was in
some measure the venting of his spleen. It
appeared in 1703, at La Haye, as <i>Nouveaux Voyages
dans l’Amérique septentrionale, qui contiennent
une Relation des différens Peuples que y habitent</i>,
in two volumes (the second entitled <i>Mémoires de
l’Amérique septentrionale, ou la suite des Voyages</i>),
with twenty-six maps and plates (Sabin, vol. x.
nos. 38,635-38,638; Carter-Brown, vol. iii. no. 36;
Quaritch, 25 shillings; Leclerc, no. 737, 40 francs).
Another edition, in somewhat larger type and
better engravings, with a vignette in place of
the sphere on the title, appeared the same year.
Dr. Shea is inclined to think this the authorized
edition, and the other a pirated one, with
reversed cuts. La Hontan, being in London,
superintended an edition published there the
same year in English, called <i>New Voyages to
North America</i> (in Harvard College Library; cf.
<i>Brinley Catalogue</i>, no. 101; Field, <i>Indian Bibliography</i>,
no. 852; Carter-Brown, vol. iii. no.
39), likewise in two volumes, but containing in
addition a Dialogue between La Hontan and a
Huron Indian (the Rat), which had not been included
in the Hague edition, and which was
the vehicle of some religious scepticism. There
were thirteen plates in vol. i., and eleven in vol.
ii., and La Hontan speaks of them as being much
better than those of the Holland edition (Sabin,
vol. x. no. 38,644). This same Dialogue was
issued separately the next year (1704) at Amsterdam
in French,&mdash;<i>Dialogue du Baron de La
Hontan et d’un Sauvage dans l’Amérique</i>; and
also, with a changed title (<i>Supplément aux Voyages
du Baron La Hontan</i>), as the third volume
or “suite” of the <i>Voyages</i>, and sometimes with
added pages devoted to travels in Portugal and
Denmark (Sabin, vol. x. nos. 38,633, 38,634,
38,637; Field, no. 853; Leclerc, nos. 738, 739;
Muller, <i>Books on America</i>, 1872, no. 864). These
editions are found with the dates also of 1704
and 1705. What is called a “seconde Édition,
revue, corrigée, et augmentée,” with twenty-seven
plates (but not from the same coppers,
however, with the earlier issues), and omitting
the “Carte générale,” appeared likewise at La
Haye in 1705 and 1706. This is professedly
“almost recast, to make the style more pure,
concise, and simple, with the Dialogues rewritten.”
The Denmark and Portugal voyage being
omitted, it is brought within two volumes, the
second of which is still called <i>Mémoires</i>, etc.
(Carter-Brown, vol. iii. no. 68). There were
later French editions in 1707, 1709, and 1715,
and at Amsterdam in 1721, with the “suite,”
dated 1728, three volumes in all, and sometimes
all three are dated 1728; and still other editions
are dated 1731 and 1741 (Sabin, vol. x. no.
38,640, who says it is quite impossible to make
a clear statement of all the varieties of these
several editions; Carter-Brown, vol. iii. no. 689).
The English version appeared again at London
in 1735 (Menzies, no. 1,178; Brinley, no. 101;
Sabin, vol. x. nos. 38,645, 38,646, who says there
are various imprints; and it is also included in
Pinkerton’s <i>Voyages</i>, vol. xiii.). There are also
a German edition, <i>Des beruhmten Herrn Baron
de La Hontan Neueste Reisen</i>, 1709 (Sabin, vol. x.
no. 38,647; Carter-Brown, vol. iii. no. 123; Stevens,
<i>Bibl. Hist.</i>, no. 2,505), and a Dutch, <i>Reizen

<p>As early as 1715-1716 there was a general
discrediting of the story of La Hontan, as
will be seen by letters addressed by Bobé to De
l’Isle, the French geographer, and printed in the
<i>Historical Magazine</i>, iii. 231, 232; but the English
geographer, Herman Moll, in his maps between
1710 and 1720, was under La Hontan’s
influence. Another English cartographer, John
Senex (1710), accepted the La Hontan story
with considerable hesitation, and later rejected
it. Daniel Coxe, in his <i>Carolana</i> (1727), quite
unreservedly accepted it; and the Long River
appears as Moingona in Popple’s <i>Atlas</i>, in
1733.</p>

<p>The German geographer, Homann, of Nuremberg,
was in some degree influenced; and the
French cartographer De l’Isle sometimes accepted
these alleged discoveries, and again discarded
them; but the careful work of Bellin, in
Charlevoix’s <i>Nouvelle France</i>, did much to relegate
La Hontan to oblivion. Charlevoix himself
says: “The great liberty which La Hontan gives
his pen has contributed greatly to make his book
read by people not informed to separate truth
from falsehood. It fails to teach the well-informed,
and confuses others. The episode of the
voyage up the Long River is as fabulous as the
Barataria of Sancho Panza.” (Cf. Shea’s ed.,
i. 86, with Shea’s note, iii. 286.) The Long
River some years later, however, figured in the
map which illustrates Samuel Engel’s <i>Extraits
raisonnés des Voyages faits dans les parties septentrionales</i>,
published at Lausanne, and again in
1765, and again in 1779, and of which there is
also a German translation. At a later date
Carver accepted the accounts of this western
river as genuine, and identified it with the St.
Peter’s,&mdash;a belief which Long again, in his <i>Expedition
to St. Peter’s River</i>, wholly rejected. (Cf.
also J. H. Perkins in the<i> North American Review</i>
(1839), vol. xlviii. no. 98, where it is thought
possible; and the paper by H. Scadding in the
<i>Canadian Journal</i>, 2d series, vol. xiii. pp. 240,
396.) Parkman expresses the present view of
scholars when he says (<i>La Salle</i>, p. 458) that
La Hontan’s account of the Long River is a
sheer fabrication; but he did not, like Hennepin,
add slander and plagiarism to mendacity.
Again, in his <i>Frontenac</i> (p. 105), he calls La
Hontan “a man in advance of his time, for he
had the caustic, sceptical, and mocking spirit
which a century later marked the approach of
the great Revolution. He usually told the truth
when he had no motive to do otherwise, and yet
was capable at times of prodigious mendacity,”
for his account of what “he saw in the colony is
commonly in accord with the best contemporary
evidence.” There are some exceptions to this
view. Gravier speaks of La Hontan as “de
bonne foi et de jugement sain”!</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="pc1 mid">THE JESUITS, RECOLLECTS, AND THE INDIANS.</p>

<p class="pc1">BY JOHN GILMARY SHEA, LL.D.</p>

<p class="drop-cap16">AT the time of the discovery of this portion of the northern continent,
the missionary spirit was active in the Catholic Church. The labors
of the earlier monks had been revived and continued in the East by the
new zeal of the orders of friars, especially of the Franciscan and Dominican
Fathers. The earlier voyages of explorations from Cabot’s day were accompanied
by priests; and as soon as the condition and character of the inhabitants
were known, projects were formed for their conversion. This work
was looked upon as a duty by the kings of Spain, Portugal, and France, as
well as by the hierarchy and religious orders. Coeval with the Spanish and
French attempts to settle on the coast, were missionary efforts, often pushed
with wonderful zeal and courage far into the interior by intrepid apostles,
who, trusting their lives to Indian guides, sought fields of labor.</p>

<p>The mission lines on the map meet and cross, as, undeterred by the
death of pioneers, others took up the task. In 1526, Dominicans reared a
chapel on the banks of the James in Virginia; in 1539, the Italian Franciscan
Mark, from Nice, penetrated to New Mexico; and soon after, Father
Padilla, of the same order, died by the hands of the Indians near the waters
of the Missouri. By 1559 Dominicans were traversing the territories of
the Mobilian tribes from Pensacola to the Mississippi; and when Melendez
founded St. Augustine, it became a mission centre whence the Jesuit missionaries
threaded the Atlantic coast to Chesapeake Bay and the banks
of the Rappahannock, before they left that field to the Franciscans, who
dotted Florida and Georgia with their mission chapels.</p>

<p>The same spirit was seen pervading France, where the conversion of the
Indians of the New World was regarded as a duty of the highest order.
One of the first traces that we find of French voyages to the northern
coast is the mention in an early edition of the Chronicle of Eusebius, in
1508, that Indians who had been brought from the new-found land received
baptism within the walls of a cathedral in France.</p>

<p>Though the introduction of Calvinism led to the destruction of many a
convent and shrine, and thinned by death the ranks of the mission orders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
the zeal for the conversion of the Indians survived the wars of religion.
Soon after Poutrincourt began his settlement in Acadia, it was made a
reproach to him that nothing had been done for the conversion of the
natives. He addressed a letter to the Pope, as if to put the fact of his
orthodoxy beyond all question; and when it was proposed to send out
Jesuit missionaries to labor among the Indians, he caused twenty-five of
the natives to be baptized in token of his zeal for their spiritual welfare.</p>

<p>The establishment of a Jesuit mission was, however, decided upon. On
the 12th of June, 1611, Fathers Peter Biard and Enemond Masse reached
Port Royal. Some difficulties had been thrown in their way, and others
met them in the petty settlement. They turned at once to study the
Micmac language, so as to begin their mission labors among that nation
of Algonquins. The aged Membertou, who had acquired some French,
was their interpreter and first convert. Biard visited all the coast as far as
the Kennebec, and tried to give some ideas of Christianity to the Abenakis
on that river. Finding that little could be done at Port Royal, where
the settlers hampered rather than aided their efforts, the Jesuits projected
an independent mission settlement elsewhere. Their protector, Madame
de Guercheville, obtained from the French king a grant of all the coast
from the St. Lawrence to Florida. A vessel was sent out, the missionaries
were taken on board, and a settlement was begun on Mount Desert Island.
There a cross was planted, and Mass said at a rustic altar. But the Jesuits
were not to carry out their mission projects. English vessels under Argall,
from Virginia, attacked the ship and settlement of St. Savior; a Jesuit laybrother
was killed; the rest of the settlers were sent to France or carried
prisoners to Virginia. Thus ended the first Jesuit mission begun under
French auspices.<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile Champlain had succeeded in establishing a settlement on the
St. Lawrence, and had penetrated to Lake Champlain and the rapids of
the Ottawa. On all sides were tribes “living like brute beasts, without law,
without religion, without God.” His religious zeal was quickened; for
Quebec itself was destitute of ministers of religion. The Recollects, a
reformed branch of the Franciscan order, were invited to enter the field.
They accepted the mission, and in May, 1615, four of the Gray Friars landed
at Quebec. Father John Dolbeau at once began a mission among the
Montagnais,&mdash;the tribe occupying that portion of the St. Lawrence valley,&mdash;and
wintered with them in their wandering hunter life, enduring all its
hardships, and learning their language and ideas. The friendly Wyandots,
from the shores of a far distant lake, were the tribe assigned to Father
Joseph le Caron, and to the palisaded towns of this more civilized race he
boldly ventured, without waiting for Champlain. In the summer of 1615
he set up his altar in a new bark lodge in the Huron town of Caragouha,
near Thunder Bay, and began to learn a new strange tongue, so as to teach
the flock around him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>The Recollects had thus undertaken to evangelize two races, who, with
their kindred, extended from the ocean to the Mississippi, from the Chesapeake
and Ohio to the frozen lands of the Esquimaux. Their languages,
differing from all known to European scholars in vocabulary, forms, and
the construction of sentences, offered incredible difficulties. The ideas
these Indians held of a future state were so obscure, that it was not easy
to find enough of natural religion by which to lead them to the revealed.
Progress was naturally slow,&mdash;there was more to discourage than to cheer.
Still the Franciscans labored on; and though their number was limited
to six, they had in 1625 five missions at Tadousac, Quebec, Three Rivers,
among the Nipissings, and in the Huron country.</p>

<p>Finding that the mission field in New France required an order bound
to less scrupulous poverty than their own, the Recollects of Paris invited
the Jesuits to aid them. Enemond Masse, of the unfortunate Acadian
mission, with Charles Lalemant and John de Brebeuf, came over in 1625.
The old opposition to the order was renewed. The Jesuits were homeless,
till the Recollects opened the doors of their convent to them. Commanding
resources from influential friends, they soon began to build,
and brought over men to swell the settlement and cultivate the ground.
They joined the Recollects in the missions already founded, profiting
by their experience. This enabled the Church to extend its missions.
Father Joseph de la Roche d’Aillon, leaving the Hurons, struck southwesterly,
and founded a mission among the Neutral Nation, apparently
on the eastern bank of the Niagara, and urged his countrymen to open
direct communication by way of Lake Ontario with that fertile part of
the country.</p>

<p>The little colony at Quebec was, however, on the verge of starvation;
and after once baffling the English, Champlain surrendered in 1629, and
the missions of the Recollects and Jesuits came to a close. A mere handful
of converts was all the reward of their long and zealous labors, and
these they were compelled to leave exposed to the danger of lapsing back
into their original heathendom.</p>

<p>We cannot trace very distinctly the system adopted by the Recollects
and their Jesuit auxiliaries during this first period of mission labor in
Canada. Their usual course was to remain during the pleasant months
at the French posts,&mdash;Quebec, Three Rivers, and Tadousac,&mdash;attending
to the spiritual wants of the French and of the Indians who encamped
near by for trade, and then to follow an Indian band on its winter hunt.
The Recollects spoke despondingly. Some young men were taken to
France and instructed there,&mdash;one, Peter Anthony, having the Prince de
Guimené as his sponsor in baptism. But they found it almost impossible
to keep the young for any prolonged instruction, and they hesitated to
baptize adults, except in case of danger of death.</p>

<p>In the Huron country Father Nicholas Viel succeeded Le Caron, and
had his little chapel at Quieunonascaran, cultivating a small patch of ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
around his bark lodge. His success does not seem to have exceeded that
of his fellow religious in the more nomadic tribes. While on his way to
Quebec in 1625 he was treacherously hurled from his canoe by a Huron
guide, and perished in the rapid waters near Montreal that still bear the
name of <i>Sault au Récollet</i>.</p>

<p>Another Recollect, Father William Poullain, while on his way with some
Frenchmen from Quebec to Sault St. Louis, fell into the hands of the
Iroquois, who were about to torture him at the stake, when he was saved
by an offer of an exchange made by his countrymen.</p>

<p>The Jesuits adopted the system of the Recollects, but we have no details
of their labors,&mdash;one Huron boy taken to France, where he was baptized
by the name of Louis de Sainte Foy, being the result of the joint labors
to which most allusion is made.</p>

<p>The Court of France seems to have considered that both Recollect and
Jesuit had failed to acquire the languages of the country sufficiently to do
the work of God and of his most Christian Majesty. At all events, each
order hastened to put in print evidence of its proficiency in American
linguistics. The Recollect Sagard published a Huron Dictionary; the
Jesuit Brebeuf, a translation of Ledesma’s Catechism into Huron, with the
Lord’s Prayer and other devotions rendered into Montagnais by Father
Enemond Masse.<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a></p>

<p>When England reluctantly yielded up her Canadian conquest, the all-powerful
Cardinal Richelieu seems to have looked with no kindly eye on
either of the bodies who had already labored to evangelize New France.
He offered the mission to his favorite order, the Capuchins, and only when
they declined it did he permit the Jesuits to return.</p>

</div>

<p>With the restoration of Canada to France by the treaty of Saint Germain
in 1632, the history of the great Jesuit missions begins. For some
years the Fathers of the Society of Jesus were, almost without exception,
the only clergy in the colony in charge of all the churches of the settlers
and the missions to the Indian tribes. When a pious association, under
the inspiration of the Venerable Mr. Olier,
founded Montreal, members of the Society
of Priests which he had formed at Saint
Sulpice became the clergy of that town;
and they gathered near it a double-tongued Indian mission, which still
continues to exist under their care. They made no attempt to extend their
labors, except in the missionary voyage of Dollier de Casson and Galinée<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
in the mission of the Abbés Fénelon and Trouvé at Quinté Bay, and the
later labors of the Abbé Picquet at Ogdensburg.</p>

<p>When Bishop Laval was appointed for Canada in 1658, he founded a
seminary at Quebec, which was aggregated to the Seminary of the Foreign
Missions in Paris. The Jesuits then resigned all the parishes which
they had directed in the colony, and confined themselves to their college
and their Indian missions. The priests of the Seminary of Quebec, beside
their parish work, also undertook missions among the Indians in Acadia,
Illinois, and on the lower Mississippi.</p>

<p>A collision between the Governor of Canada and the Bishop with his
clergy and the Jesuits, in regard to the sale of liquor to the Indians, led the
Government to send back the Recollects to resume their early labors.
They did not, however, undertake any important missions among the
Indian tribes. Their efforts were confined almost exclusively to the period
and course of La Salle’s attempts at settlement and exploration, and to a
mission at Gaspé and a shorter one on the Penobscot.</p>

<p>When the colony of Louisiana took form, the Indian missions there
were confided to the Jesuits, who directed them till the suppression of the
order terminated their existence in the dominions of France. Spain, in
her colonies, sent other orders to continue the work of the Jesuits, and
this was done successfully in some places; but there was no effort made
to sustain those of the Jesuits in Canada and Louisiana, and amid the political
changes which rapidly ensued the early French missions gradually
dwindled away.</p>

<p>These Jesuit missions embraced the labors of the Fathers among the
Micmacs, chiefly on Cape Breton Island and at Miscou; the missions
among the Montagnais, Bersiamites, Oumamiwek, Porcupine Indians, Papinachois,
and other tribes of the lower St. Lawrence and Saguenay, the
centre being at Tadousac; the missions of which Quebec was the immediate
centre, comprising the work among the Montagnais of that district
and Algonquins from the west. Of this Algonquin mission, Sillery soon
became the main mission; but as the Algonquins disappeared, Abenakis
came to settle there, and remained till the chapel was removed to St.
François de Sales. Then Three Rivers was a mission station for the Indians
near it, and for the Attikamegues inland, till a separate mission was established
for that tribe. Beyond Montreal was the mission to the Nipissings,
and the great Huron mission, the scene of the most arduous and continued
labors of the Fathers among the palisaded towns of the Wyandots and
Dinondadies. After the ruin of these nations, the Jesuits led one part of
the survivors to Isle Orleans, and subsequently gathered a remnant of them
at Lorette, where their descendants still remain. The rest fled towards the
Mississippi, and were zealously followed by the energetic missionaries,
who gathered them at Mackinac, whence they removed in time to Detroit,
and ultimately to Sandusky, the last point where the Jesuits ministered
to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>Beyond Lake Huron was the great Ottawa mission, embracing the
attempts to christianize the Ottawas on Lake Superior, the Chippewas
at Sault Ste. Marie, the Beaver Indians and Crees; at Green Bay was
another post for the Menomonees, Pottawatamies, Foxes, and Mascoutens;
while south of Lake Michigan came in time Jesuit labors among
the Miamis and Illinois. The missions attempted among the Sioux beyond
the Mississippi mark the western limit of the old Jesuit efforts to
convert the native tribes.</p>

<p>With the establishment of Louisiana came the missions of the Society
among the Yazoos, Arkansas, Choctaws, Alibamons, and other tribes.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">The Micmac Mission.</span>&mdash;The Jesuit missions among the Micmacs never
attained any remarkable development, and most of the territory occupied
by this branch of the Algonquin family was attended by other bodies of
missionaries. Father Julian Perrault began his labors on Cape Breton in
1634; Charles Turgis, with others, was at Miscou in the following years.
Most of the Jesuits, however, were compelled to withdraw with shattered
health; and Turgis, devoting himself to the care of the sick, died at his
post in 1637. Father John Dolebeau became paralyzed, and while returning
to France was blown up at sea. At last,
however, Father Andrew Richard and Martin
de Lyonne succeeded in founding a mission;
they learned the language, and extended their labors to Chaleurs Bay, Ile
Percée, Miramichi, and Chédabuctou, finding one old woman who had been
baptized by Biard at Port Royal. Lyonne died, devotedly attending the
sick, in 1661; Richard continued his labors some years later, aided for a
time by James Fremin, and cheered by visits from his superior, Jerome
Lalemant. They made some converts, although they did not banish the
old superstitions and savagery of the tribe; but when Bishop Laval visited
Gaspé in 1659, the missionaries presented one hundred and forty Indian
Christians for confirmation.</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-268.jpg" width="200" height="33" id="i268"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>When Richard’s labors ceased, the Recollects took charge of the mission
at Isle Percée, where French and Indians were attended from about
1673 by Fathers Hilarion Guesnin and Exuperius Dethune. They were
succeeded in 1675 by Father Christian Le Clercq, who took up the Indian
mission with zeal, and has left ineffaceable traces of his twelve years’ labor.
He acquired the Micmac language; and finding that some Indians, to aid
their memory in retaining his instructions, employed a system of hieroglyphics
on bits of bark, he studied and improved it, till he had the daily
prayers, mass, and catechism in this form. The Indians readily adopted
these hieroglyphics, and taught them to their children and later converts.
They have been retained in use till the present, and the Rev. Christian
Kauder, a Redemptorist, had type cut in Austria, and published a catechism,
hymn and prayer book, in them at Vienna in 1866. In 1685 land
was given to the priests of the Seminary of Quebec; gentlemen of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
body, with some Recollects and occasionally a Jesuit Father, served the
coast from Gaspé to Nova Scotia, and all the Micmacs became Catholics.
They seem to have been attended with the French, and not as a distinct
mission. The Micmac territory included not only the coast, but Cape
Breton, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland. Of these missionaries,
Messrs. Thury and Gaulin and the Recollect Felix Pain seem to have been
the most prominent. The Abbé Anthony S. Maillard, who was missionary
to the Micmacs in Cape Breton and Acadia till his death in 1768, exercised
great influence; and his mastery of the language is shown in his Grammar
of the Micmac, which was printed at New York in 1864.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">The Montagnais Mission.</span>&mdash;Tadousac was from the commencement
of French settlement on the St. Lawrence an anchoring-place for vessels
and a trading-station which attracted Indians from the west and north.
Missionaries made visits to the spot from an early period, but the Jesuit
mission there is regarded as having been founded in 1640. It received
charitable aid from the Duchess d’Aiguillon, who maintained for a time the
Fathers employed there. Father John de Quen may be said to have established
the first permanent mission, from which gradually extended efforts
for christianizing the tribes on the shores down to Labrador and on the
upper waters of the Saguenay.</p>

<p>The first mission was the result of the effort of Charles Meiachkwat, a
Montagnais who had visited Sillery and induced the Jesuit Fathers to send
one of their number to Tadousac. Charles erected the first chapel; and
may be regarded as the first native Christian of that district, and first
native catechist, for he visited neighboring tribes to impart what religious
knowledge he had learned.</p>

<p>The missionaries encountered the usual difficulties,&mdash;great laxity of
morals, a deep-rooted belief in dreams, the influence of the medicine-men,
and vices introduced by the traders, especially intoxication. Father Buteux,
who replaced De Quen for a time, seems to have been the first to give his
neophytes the kind of calendar still in use among the wandering Indians,
with spaces for each day, to be marked off as it came, and Sundays and
holidays so designated by symbols that they could recognize and observe
them.</p>

<p>The missionaries at first went down from Quebec in the spring, and continued
their labors till autumn, when the Indians scattered for the winter
hunt; but as the neophytes felt the want of a regular ministry during the
winter, they attempted, in 1645, to supply it by performing some of the
priestly functions themselves. This led to fuller instruction; and to impress
them, the missionaries left marked pieces of wood of different colors,
called <i>massinahigan</i>, a word still in use in all the Catholic missions among
Algonquin nations for a book of prayers.</p>

<p>In 1646 De Quen ascended the Saguenay, and penetrated, by way of the
Chicoutimi, to Lake St. John, in order to preach to the Porcupine tribe, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
had already erected a cross in their village. Three years later, Father
Gabriel Druillettes visited the same tribe and reared his bark chapel among
them. In 1651 De Quen made another
missionary excursion, reaching various
villages on the lake, and subsequently, returning to Tadousac, sailed down
the St. Lawrence till he reached bands of the Oumamiwek or Bersiamites,
among whom he began mission work.</p>

<p>The mission of the Holy Cross at Tadousac was, however, the scene of
the most assiduous labors, as often a thousand Indians of different tribes
would be encamped there; and though nothing could be done to check the
errant life of these Algonquins, ideas of Christian morality and faith were
inculcated, and much reformation was effected. In 1660 Father Jerome
Lalemant, superior of the missions, continued the labors of his predecessors
on Lake St. John, and ascending the Mistassini, reached Nekouba,
then a gathering-place for the Algonquin tribes of the interior. Here
they hoped to reach several nations who had never seen a missionary,
and especially the Ecureuil, or Squirrel tribe; but the Iroquois war-parties
had penetrated farther than missionary zeal, and the Jesuits found the
Algonquins of these remote cantons fleeing in all directions after sustaining
a series of defeats from the fierce men-hunters from the Mohawk and
Oswego. The great aim was to reach the Crees, but that nation was subsequently
approached by way of the great lakes, when the route in that
direction was opened by Menard.</p>

<p>Bailloquet and Nouvel wintered in successive years with bands of Montagnais,
travelling in snow-shoes, and drawing their chapel requisites on a
sled, as they followed the hunters, pitching their tents on
encountering other parties, to enable them to fulfil their
religious duties. Then, in the spring of 1664, while Druillettes
visited the tribes on the upper waters of the Saguenay, Nouvel ascended
the Manicouagan to the lake of that name in the country of the
Papinachois, a part yet untrodden by the foot of the white man. Some
of the tribe were already Christians, converted at the mission posts; but
to most the missionary was an object of wonder, and his rude chapel a
never-ceasing marvel to them and to a more northerly tribe, the Ouchestigouetch,
who soon came to camp beside the mission cross.</p>

<p>Nouvel cultivated this tribe for several years, wintering among them, or
pursuing them in their scattered cabins, till the spring of 1667, when all
the Christians of these Montagnais bands gathered at Tadousac to meet
Bishop Laval, who, visiting his diocese in his bark canoe, was coming to
confer on those deemed sufficiently grounded in the faith the sacrament
of confirmation. He reached Tadousac on the 24th of June, and was
welcomed by four hundred Christian Indians, who escorted him to the
temporary bark chapel, for the church had been totally destroyed by fire.
The bishop confirmed one hundred and forty-nine.</p>

<p>Beaulieu, Albanel, and Druillettes labored there in the following years;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
but small-pox and other diseases, with want caused by the Iroquois driving
them from their hunting-grounds, had reduced the Indians, so that, as
Albanel states, in 1670 Tadousac was almost deserted,&mdash;not
more than one hundred Indians assembled
there, whereas he remembered the time when one
could count a thousand or twelve hundred encamped at the post at once;
and of this petty band some were Micmacs from Gaspé, and Algonquins
from Sillery.</p>

<p>In 1671, while Father de Crépieul remained in charge of the missions
near Tadousac, with which he was for years identified, Albanel, with the
Sieur Denys de St. Simon, ascended the Saguenay, and wintering near Lake
St. John pushed on by Lake and River Nemiskau, till they reached the
shores of Hudson’s Bay, where the Jesuit planted his cross and began a mission.
On his way to revisit it in 1674, he was crippled by an accident, and
Albanel found him helpless in mid-winter in the woods near Lake St. John.
Crépieul then visited the Papinachois in their country, as Father Louis
Nicolas did the Oumamis at the Seven Islands. Boucher, a few years later,
aided Crépieul, and from their chapels at Chicoutimi and Metabetchouan as
centres, missionary excursions were made in
all directions.</p>

<p>Dalmas, a later auxiliary of Crépieul, after
wintering at Chicoutimi, was killed in the spring of 1694 on the shores of
Hudson’s Bay.</p>

<p>De Crépieul clung to his arduous mission till 1702, when, broken by his
long and severe labors, he retired to Quebec, where he died soon after.</p>

<p>Peter Michael Laure, who occupied the same field from 1720 to 1737,
drew up a Montagnais grammar and dictionary, greatly aided, as his manuscript
tells us, by the pious Mary Outchiwanich.</p>

<p>Father John Baptist La Crosse was the last of the old Jesuit missionaries
at Tadousac and Chicoutimi, dying at the former post in 1782, after the
suppression of his order and the disasters of his countrymen. He taught
many of his flock to read and write, and they handed down the knowledge
from parent to child, clinging to the religious books and Bible selections
made for them by this missionary, of whom they still recount wonderful
works.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">The Missions at Quebec, Three Rivers, and Sillery.</span>&mdash;The
Jesuit missionaries on returning to Canada in 1632 resumed the instruction
of the wandering Montagnais near Quebec, Father Le Jeune taking the
lead; and when a post was established at
Three Rivers, Father Buteux began there the
devoted labors which ended only with his life.
The missionaries during the time of trade
when Indians gathered at the French posts endeavored to gain their good-will,
and instructed all who evinced any good disposition; during the rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
of the year they made visits to wandering bands, often wintering with them,
sharing the dangers and privations of their hunting expeditions amid mountains,
rapids, and forests.</p>

<p>It was soon evident that their precarious mode of life, the rapid diminution
of game when they began to kill the animals for their furs and not merely for
food, small-pox and other diseases introduced by the French, and the slaughters
committed by the Iroquois,
would soon sweep
away the Upper Montagnais,
unless they could be
made sedentary. A few
endeavored to settle near
the French and maintain
themselves by agriculture,
but in 1637 the missionaries
began a kind of reduction
at a place above
Quebec called at first St.
Joseph, but soon known as
Sillery, from the name of
the pious and benevolent
Commander de Sillery in
France, who gave means
for the good work. Two
families, comprising
twenty souls in all, settled
here, in houses built for
them, and began to cultivate the ground. Others soon joined them, and plots
were allotted to the several families. Of this settlement Noel Negabamat
may be regarded as the founder. Though Sillery was ravaged by disease,
which soon broke out in the cabins, the project seemed full of promise; the
Indians elected chiefs, and a form of government was adopted. The nuns
sent out in 1639 to found a hospital, for which the Duchesse d’Aiguillon gave
the necessary means, aided the missionaries greatly. From the day they
landed, these self-sacrificing nuns opened wards for the reception of sick
Indians, and they decided to establish their hospital at Sillery. They carried
out this resolution, and opened it on the first of December, 1640, receiving
both French and Indian patients. Their services impressed the natives more
deeply than did the educational efforts of the Jesuit Fathers and of the Ursuline
nuns, who had schools for Indian children of various tribes at Quebec.</p>

<p>This mission was an object of especial care, and great hopes were entertained
of its effecting much in civilizing and converting the Montagnais and
Algonquins, both of which nations were represented in the first settlers at
St. Joseph’s. These Indians were induced to cultivate the ground, but they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
still depended on their fishing, and the winter hunt carried them off to the
woods. This the missionaries could not prevent, as the hunts supplied the
furs for the trade of the company which controlled Canada.</p>

<p>The hopes of the Jesuits were not to be realized. Some progress was
made, and converts like Noel Negabamat and Charles Meiachkwat exercised
great influence; but the Iroquois war-parties soon drove the new agriculturists
from their fields, the nuns removed their hospital to Quebec in 1646,
and the neophytes were scattered. “We behold ourselves dying, exterminated
every day,” wrote Negabamat in 1651. Some years after, an
accidental fire destroyed St. Michael’s church with the mission house,
and from that time the Indian settlement at Sillery languished. Disease
and excess aided the work of war, and the Algonquins and Montagnais
dwindled away.</p>

<p>As early as 1643 some Abenakis from the banks of the Kennebec had
visited Sillery, and one chief was baptized. Father Druillettes soon after
visited their towns, and founded a mission in their country. This was at
first continued, but the Christians of the tribe and those seeking instruction
visited Sillery from time to time. This was especially the case after 1657,
when the Jesuits suspended their labors in Maine, for fear of giving umbrage
to the Capuchin Fathers who had missions on the coast.</p>

<div class="floatleft">

         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>Sillery revived as an Abenaki mission, but the soil at last proved unfit
for longer cultivation by Indians. By this
time, Fathers James and Vincent Bigot
had been assigned to this tribe. They
looked out for a new mission site, and by the aid of the Marchioness de
Bauche bought a tract on the Chaudière River, and in 1683 established
near the beautiful falls the mission of St. Francis de Sales.
Sillery was abandoned, and there
was nothing to mark the famous old mission
site, till a monument was erected a few years ago to the memory of Masse
and De Noue, who lie there.</p>

<div class="floatright">

<p>With the chapel of St. Francis as a base, a new series of missions gradually
spread into Maine. The Jesuits resumed their ministry on the banks of the
Kennebec; the Bigots, followed by Rale, Lauverjeat, Loyard, and Sirenne,
keeping up their work amid great danger,
their presence exciting the most
fearful animosity in the minds of New
Englanders, who ascribed all Indian hostilities to them. Rale was especially
marked out. Though a man of cultivation and a scholar,&mdash;his
Abenaki dictionary being a monument of his mastery of the language,&mdash;a
price was set on his head, his chapel was pillaged by one expedition,
which carried off his manuscript dictionary<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> (now one of the curiosities in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
Harvard College Library), and in a later expedition he was slain at the
foot of his mission cross, August 23, 1724. He knew his danger, and his
superior would have withdrawn him, but the Canadian authorities insisted
on his remaining.</p>

<p>Besides this Jesuit mission at Norridgewock, the priests of the seminary
at Quebec, anxious to do their part in the mission-work of which their
parent institution, the Seminary of the Foreign Missions at Paris, did so
much, founded a mission on the Penobscot. This was long directed by the
Rev. Peter Thury, who acquired great influence over the Indians, accompanying
them in peace and war till his death in 1699. A Recollect, Father
Simon, had a mission at Medoktek, on the St. John’s, which was subsequently
directed by the Jesuits, as well as that on the Penobscot.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the mission on the Chaudière had been transferred to the site
still known as St. François, and on the death of Rale bands of the Kennebec
Indians emigrated to it, forming a strong Indian village, which sent
many a vindictive war-party on the frontiers of New England. This drew
on it fierce retaliation from Rogers and his partisan corps, who captured
the village, killed many, and fired church and dwellings.<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">The Missions at Three Rivers and Montreal.</span>&mdash;Ascending the
St. Lawrence, the next mission centre was Three Rivers, where the Jesuit
missionaries Le Jeune and Buteux resumed, in 1633, the labors of the
Recollect Brother Du Plessis and Fathers Huet and Poullain. It was a
place of trade where Indians gathered, so that the missionaries found constant
objects of their care. Many were instructed, and returned to impart
to others their newly acquired knowledge of God’s way with man, and the
consolations of Christianity.</p>

<p>Gradually the Indians who had settled near Three Rivers were almost
entirely won; while the Attikamegues, or White Fish Indians, dwelling far
inland, came to ask a missionary to reside among them. They were of the
Montagnais tongue, and remarkable for their gentle character. Father
Buteux, charmed with their docility, instructed them; and at last, in 1651,
ascended the river, and after a toilsome journey of fifty-three days, reached
their country. All who had not become Christians already were anxiously
awaiting his arrival; a rude chapel was raised, and the neophytes in their
fervor crowded to it to listen or to pray. The next year Buteux set out
once more to make a missionary visit to this interesting race; but the Iroquois
were on their track, and the missionary while making a portage received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
two fatal wounds, and died amid his arduous duties. The tribe was
soon nearly annihilated, the survivors seeking refuge among the remote
lodges of the scattered Montagnais.</p>

<p>Among the converts at Three Rivers was Pieskaret, the most famous
warrior of the Montagnais or Adirondacks, whose bravery was the terror of
the Iroquois. But the Indians of that portion of the St. Lawrence valley
were doomed,&mdash;nearly all were swept away by the Iroquois; and after the
death of Buteux the Montagnais mission at Three Rivers seems to have
numbered few Indians, nearly all the survivors having fled to their kindred
tribes near Tadousac.</p>

<p>When the settlement at Montreal was formed in 1641 by Maisonneuve
acting under the Society of Montreal, the Jesuits were the first clergymen
of the new town, and began to labor among the Indians who gathered
there from the St. Lawrence and Ottawa. This mission of the Jesuits was
not, however, a permanent one. The Sulpitians,&mdash;a community of priests
established in Paris by the Rev. John James Olier, one of the members of
the Montreal society,&mdash;became the proprietors of the new settlement, and
they continue still in charge of churches, institutions, and missions on or
near Montreal island, after a lapse of more than two centuries. An Indian
mission for Algonquins was begun on the mountain at a spot now known
as the Priests’ Farm,
chiefly by the liberality
and zeal of the
Rev. Mr. Belmont.
Iroquois and Hurons also came, and the mission was removed to Sault au
Récollet, and then to the Lake of the Two Mountains. Here it still exists,
embracing an Iroquois village and one of Algonquin language, made up
in no small part of Nipissings from the lake of that name. This is the oldest
mission organization in Canada, the Sulpitians having been unmolested
by the English Government, which put an end to the communities of the
Jesuits and Recollects.</p>

<p>Above Montreal no permanent missions were attempted among the
Algonquin bands dotted along the line of the Ottawa,&mdash;the Indians seeking
instruction on their visits to the French posts and missions, or receiving
missionaries from time to time, as their river was the great highway to
the West.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">The Huron Mission.</span>&mdash;The Huron nation in Upper Canada, a confederacy
of tribes allied in origin and language to the Iroquois, had been
already the field of a mission conducted by Recollects, aided after a time
by the Jesuits. When Canada was restored to France by the treaty of St.
Germain, Brebeuf penetrated to his old mission, in 1634, accompanied by
Fathers Daniel and Davost, and in September erected a log chapel in the
town of Ihonatiria. Thus began the greatest of the Jesuit missions in
Canada, which called forth the most intrepid courage of the heralds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
Christianity, and triumphed over the heathen hostility in the tribes, only
to perish at last by the hands of the terrible Iroquois.</p>

<p>The Hurons lived in palisaded towns, their bark cabins clustering within,
while the fields where they cultivated corn, beans, pumpkins, and tobacco
lay near. Their hunting and fishing excursions were comparatively short,
and they laid up stores of provisions for winter. The opportunity for instructing
the people was accordingly much greater than among the nomadic
tribes of the Algonquin family. Brebeuf, already versed in the language,
extended his studies and initiated his associates into its intricate peculiarities.
The young were the first care, and catechetical instructions were daily
given to all whom they could gather. The Lord’s Prayer and other devotions
were taught; but it was not easy to secure continuous attendance.
This led to the project of a school at Quebec, to which some of the most
promising boys were sent. There, with less to tempt them, more progress
was made; yet the result was but temporary, for the pupils on returning
to the upper country threw aside their slight civilization.</p>

<p>As other missionaries arrived, the labors of the Fathers in the Huron
country extended; but they found that the medicine-men were bitter enemies,
foreseeing a loss of all their influence. The march of Europeans
through America always spread new diseases. In the Huron country the
ravages were severe. The medicine-men ascribed all to the missionaries.
Cabins were closed against them; their lives were in constant peril. Their
house was set on fire, and a council of the three tribes met to decide
whether they should all be put to death. The undaunted missionaries prepared
to meet their fate, committing their chapel service and the fruit of
their Indian studies to Peter Tsiwendeentaha, their first adult convert. Their
fearless conduct at last triumphed. Adults came to solicit instruction;
Ossossare and Teananstayae became mission stations, four Fathers laboring
in each, while Garnier and Jogues proceeded
to the towns of the Tionontates, a kindred
tribe, who from their cultivation and sale of
tobacco were generally called by the French the Petun, or Tobacco tribe.
As new stations were formed and chapels built in the Huron towns, the
missionaries in 1639 erected on the River Wye the mission-house of St.
Mary’s, to serve as a centre from which priests could be sent to any of the
towns, and where they could always find refuge. They extended their
labors to the Neutral Nation and to the Algonquin tribes lying near the
Huron country, reaching as far as Sault Ste. Marie. The missionaries endured
great hardships and sufferings on these journeys from hunger, cold,
and accident,&mdash;Brebeuf having broken his collar-bone by a fall, and reaching
his lodge only by a long and weary progress on his hands and knees.
Their efforts seemed almost vain. In 1640 they could claim only one
hundred Christians out of sixteen thousand Hurons; a few prominent
chiefs had joined them, but the young braves would not submit to the law
of the gospel. Christian families, and still more Christians in heathen families,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
were subjected to much persecution, till the number of catechumens in
a town enabled them to take a firm stand.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Five Nations, freely supplied with firearms by the Dutch,
were annihilating the Huron tribes, already weakened by disease. The
war interrupted intercourse between the Huron country and Quebec.
Father Jogues, sent down in 1642 to obtain supplies for the mission,
while journeying back, fell with many Hurons into the hands of the Mohawks,
who killed most of the party, and led the rest with the missionary
to their towns. The missionary and his attendant, René Goupil, were
tortured and mutilated, reduced to the rude slavery of Indian life, and
witnessed the execution of most of their Hurons. Full of missionary zeal,
they endeavored to impart some ideas of Christianity; but the effort cost
Goupil his life, and Jogues was with difficulty rescued by the Dutch, and
sent to Europe.</p>

<p>The missionaries in the Huron country, by the loss of the supplies in
the Huron flotilla, were reduced to great straits, till Brebeuf reached them
with two assistants, Garreau and Chabanel,
whom no dangers could deter.
Father Bressani, returning to his western
labors, was less fortunate; he too was
captured, and endured all but death at
the hands of the Mohawks. His sufferings led the charitable Dutch to
effect his release. Yet neither Jogues nor Bressani faltered; both returned
to Canada to continue their perilous work.</p>

<p>When a temporary peace gave the Huron mission a respite, there were
five churches in as many towns, and one for Algonquins living in the
Huron country. The voice of the missionary seemed to find more hearers,
and converts increased; but the end was at hand.</p>

<p>In July, 1648, the Iroquois attacked Teananstayae. As the braves
manned the palisades, Father Daniel was among them to give them the
consolations of religion, to confess and baptize; then he hurried to the
cabins to minister to the sick and aged. He found his chapel full, and
urging them to flight from the rear, he closed the front portal behind him,
and awaited the Iroquois braves, who had stormed the palisade and were
swooping down on the cross-crowned church. Riddled by arrows and
balls, he fell dead, and his body was flung into the burning church of St.
Joseph.</p>

<p>The capture of this town seemed a death-blow to hope in the bosoms
of the Hurons. They abandoned many of their towns, and fled to the
islands of Lake Huron or the towns of the Petuns. They could not be
aroused to any system of defence or precaution.</p>

<p>On the 16th of the ensuing March, a force of a thousand Iroquois
stormed, at daybreak, the Huron town which the missionaries called St.
Ignatius. So general and complete was the massacre, that only three escaped
to the next large town, St. Louis. Here were stationed the veteran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
Brebeuf, companion of the early Recollect missioners in the land, friend
of Champlain, and with him as associate the young Gabriel Lalemant.
The Hurons urged the missionaries to
fly; but, like Daniel, they remained, exercising
their ministry to the last, and
attending to every call of zeal. The Hurons repelled the first assault; but
their palisade was carried at last, and the victorious Iroquois fired the
cabins. The missionaries, while ministering to the wounded and dying,
were captured. They were taken, with other captives, to the ruined town
of St. Ignatius, and there a horrible torture began. They were bound to
the stake; Brebeuf’s hands were cut off; Lalemant’s body bristled with
awls and iron barbs; red-hot hatchets were pressed under their arms and
between their legs; and around the neck of Brebeuf a collar of these
weapons was placed. But the heroic old missionary denounced God’s vengeance
on the savages for their cruelty and hatred of Christianity, till they
cut off his nose and lips, and thrust a firebrand into his mouth. They
sliced off his flesh and devoured it, and, scalping him, poured boiling water
on his head, in mockery of baptism; then they hacked off his feet, clove
open his chest, and devoured his heart. Lalemant was wrapped in bark to
which fire was applied, and underwent many of the same tortures as the
older missionary; he too was baptized in mockery, his eyes torn out and
coals forced into the sockets. After torturing him all the night, his tormenters
clove his head asunder at dawn.</p>

</div>

<p>St Mary’s was menaced; but the Huron fugitives there sent out a party
which repulsed the Iroquois, who then retired, sated with their vengeance.
The Huron nation was destroyed. Fifteen towns were abandoned. One
tribe, the Scanonaenrat, submitted to the Iroquois, and removed to the
Seneca country in a body, with many Hurons of other tribes. Some bands
fled to the Petuns, Neuters, Eries, or Susquehannas. A part, following the
first fugitives to the islands in Lake Huron, roamed to Lake Michigan and
Lake Superior. These were in time brought back by later missionaries
to Mackinac.</p>

<p>The Huron mission was overthrown. A few of the Jesuit missionaries
followed the fugitives to St. Joseph’s Island; others joined Garnier in the
Petun mission. But that too was doomed. Echarita was attacked in
December, the Iroquois avoiding the Petun braves who had sallied out
to meet them. Garnier, a man of singularly attractive character, earnest
and devoted, though mortally wounded, dragged himself along on the
ground to minister to the wounded, and was tomahawked as he was in the
act of absolving one. Another missionary, Chabanel, was killed by an
apostate Huron. Their comrades accompanied the fugitive Petuns as
they scattered and sought refuge in the islands. The number of the
Hurons and Petuns was too great for the limited and hasty agriculture
to maintain. Great misery ensued. In June, 1650, the missionaries abandoned
the Huron country, and descended to Quebec with a number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
the Hurons. This remnant of a once powerful nation were placed on
Isle Orleans; but the Iroquois swept many of them off, and the survivors
found a home at Lorette, where their descendants still remain.</p>

<p>Thus ended the Huron mission in Upper Canada, which was begun
by the Recollect Le Caron in 1615, and which had employed twenty-nine
missionaries, seven of whom had yielded up their lives as the best earnest
of their sincerity and devotion to the cause of Christian progress.</p>

<p>The Jesuit missions were by this time reduced to a most shadowy state.
The Iroquois had almost entirely swept away the Montagnais tribes on the
St. Lawrence above the Saguenay; they had cut to pieces most of the
bands of Algonquins on the Ottawa, while the country of the Hurons,
Petuns, and Neuters was a desert. The trading-posts of the French at
Montreal, Three Rivers, and Quebec were almost forsaken; no longer
did flotillas come laden with peltries to gladden the merchants, and give
missionaries an opportunity to address distant tribes. Several missionaries
returned to Europe, as there seemed no field to be reached in
America.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, such a field presented itself. The Iroquois, who had
carried off a missionary&mdash;Father Poncet&mdash;from near Quebec, proposed
peace. They were in a fierce war with the Eries and Susquehannas, and
probably found that in their bloodthirsty march they were making the land
a desert, cutting off all supplies of furs from Dutch and French alike. At all
events, they restored Poncet, and, proposing peace, solicited missionaries.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">The Iroquois Mission.</span>&mdash;War with the Iroquois had been almost uninterrupted
since the settlement of Canada. Champlain found the Canadian
tribes of every origin arrayed against the fierce confederation which
in their symbolic language “formed a cabin.” The founder of Canada
had gone to the very heart of the Iroquois country, and at the head of
his swarthy allies had given them battle on the shores of Lake Champlain
and on the borders of Lake Oneida. But the war had brought the
French colony to the brink of ruin, and swept its allies from the face
of the earth.</p>

</div>

<p>Now peace was to open to missionary influence the castles of this all-conquering
people, and a foothold was to be gained there; and not only
this, but, relieved from war, Canada was to open intercourse with the great
West, and new missions were to be attempted
in the basin of the upper lakes and in the
valley of the Mississippi. The missionaries
of Canada were thus to extend their labors within the present limits of our
republic on the north, as the Franciscans of Spain were doing along the
southern part from Florida to New Mexico.</p>

<p>The Recollect Joseph de la Roche d’Allion had already in early days
crossed the Niagara from the west; Jogues and Raymbault had planted the
cross at Sault Ste. Marie; Father Jogues had attempted to found a mission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
on the banks of the Mohawk; but his body, with the bodies of Goupil and
Lalande, had mouldered to dust in our soil.</p>

<p>Father Simon le Moyne, who had succeeded to the Indian name of
Jogues, and who inherited his spirit, was the interpreter in the recent negotiations,
and had been invited to Onondaga and the Mohawk. For the
former, the seat of the council-fire of the Iroquois league, he set out from
Quebec July 2, 1654, and reached Onondaga by a route then new to the
French, passing through the St. Lawrence, Lake Ontario, and the Oswego.
He was favorably received at Onondaga, and the sachems, formally by a
wampum belt, invited the French to build a house on Lake Ontario.</p>

<p>There was already a Christian element in the Iroquois cantons. Each of
the cantons contained hundreds of Hurons, all instructed in the fundamental
doctrines of Christianity, and not a few openly professing it; while in the
Seneca country was a town made up of the Scanonaenrat Hurons, Petuns,
and Neuters. Le Moyne found wherever he went Christians eager to enjoy
his ministry.</p>

<div class="floatleft">

         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>His embassy filled all with hope; and the next year, as the Onondagas,
through a Christian chief, solicited the establishment of a mission by the
Jesuit Fathers, Peter Joseph Chaumonot and Claude Dablon were selected.
They reached Onondaga, and after a formal reception by the sachems with
harangues and exchange of wampum belts, the missionaries were escorted
to the spot given to them for their house and chapel. Two springs, one salt
and one of clear, sparkling fresh water, still known as the Jesuits’ well, mark
the knoll where St. Mary’s of Ganentaa was speedily erected. The Canadian
missionaries, from their resources and alms contributed in France,
spent large amounts to make this new central mission adapted for all the
fond hopes planned for its future work in diffusing the gospel.</p>

</div>

<p>The missionaries found the greatest encouragement in the interest manifested,
and in the numbers who came to solicit instruction. They labored
assiduously to gather the unexpected harvest; but mistrust soon came, with
reports of hostile
action by the
French. Dablon
returned to Canada,
and a party of French under Captain Dupuis set out to begin a settlement
at Onondaga, while Fathers Le Mercier and Menard went to extend
the missions. They were welcomed with all the formalities of Indian courtesy;
and while Dupuis and his
men prepared to form the settlement,
the missionaries erected a second chapel at the Onondaga castle,
which was attended from Ganentaa. Then René Menard began a mission
among the Cayugas, and Chaumonot, passing still farther, visited the Seneca
town of Gandagare, and that occupied by the Scanonaenrat, many of whom
were already Christians, and more ready to embrace the faith. The Senecas
themselves showed a disposition to listen to Christian doctrines. Finding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
the field thus full of
promise, Chaumonot
and Menard returned
to Onondaga, whence
they were despatched
to Oneida. Here they
found less promise,
but there were captive
Hurons to profit
by their ministry.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Father
Le Moyne had visited
the Mohawk canton
from Canada, and
prepared the way for
a mission in that
tribe.</p>

<p>Thus at the close
of 1656 missionaries
had visited each of
the Five Nations, and
all seemed ready for
the establishment of
new and thriving missions.
The next year
signs of danger appeared.
A party of
Hurons compelled to
remove to Onondaga
were nearly all massacred
on the way, the
missionaries Ragueneau
and Duperon in
vain endeavoring to
stay the work of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
slaughter, which was coolly ascribed to them. The Mohawks, though they
received Le Moyne, were openly hostile. They attacked a flotilla of Ottawas
at Montreal, and slew the missionary Leonard Garreau, who was on his
way to the far West, to establish missions on the upper lakes.</p>

<div class="floatleft">

</div>

<p>The missionaries in the cantons and the little French colony at Onondaga
were soon evidently doomed to a like fate. So evident was the hostility
of the Five Nations, that Governor d’Ailleboust arrested all the Iroquois in
Canada to hold them as hostages.
The missionaries at
Ganentaa saw their danger,
and through the winter formed
plans for escape. At last, in March, they prepared for a secret flight, and
to cover their design gave a banquet to the Onondagas, adopting the kind
in which, according to Indian custom, all the food must be eaten. Dances
and games were kept up till a late hour; and when the weary guests at
last departed, the French, who had amid the din borne to the water’s edge
boats and canoes secretly prepared in their house, embarked, and, plying
oar and paddle all night long, reached Lake Ontario unseen and undiscovered
even by a wandering hunter. It was not till the following evening
that the Onondagas, finding the house at Ganentaa still and quiet, discovered
that the French had vanished. But the mode of escape was long
a mystery to them, so cautiously and adroitly had all the preparations for
flight been made.</p>

<p>Le Moyne, in similar peril on the Mohawk, wrote a farewell letter, which
he committed to the Dutch authorities; but the sachems of the tribe suddenly
sent him to Montreal in the care of a party, so that in March, 1657,
the Jesuit missionaries had all withdrawn from the territory of the Five
Nations, after their short but laborious effort to open the eyes of the people
to the truths of religion.</p>

<p>The Iroquois then dropped the mask, and war parties swept through the
French colony, filling it with fire and blood. Yet the influence of the missionaries
had not been in vain. One able man, Garakonthié, had listened
and studied, though his unmoved countenance gave no token of interest or
assent. He became the protector of the Indian Christians and of French
prisoners, as well as an open advocate of peace. Saonchiogwa, the Cayuga
sachem, embraced his views, and in the summer of 1660 appeared at Montreal
as an envoy of peace, restoring some prisoners and demanding a missionary
for Onondaga. The Governor of Canada hesitated to ask any of
the Jesuit Fathers to undertake so perilous a duty; but as the lives of the
French at Onondaga depended on it, Father Le Moyne intrepidly undertook
the mission. He was waylaid by Oneidas, but escaped, and reached
Oswego. Garakonthié came out to meet him. Once more peace was ratified.
Nine prisoners accompanied Garakonthié to Montreal, Le Moyne
remaining; but so frail was the newly established peace, that war parties
from Mohawk and Onondaga slew, near Montreal, two zealous Sulpitians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
the Rev. Messrs. Vignal and Le Maître. Though aware that any moment
might be his last, Le Moyne labored on at Onondaga and Cayuga among
Huron captives and native Iroquois, many, especially women, having become
Christians, and instructing others whom they brought to the missionary.
His labors ended in the spring of 1661, when he returned to
Canada with the rest of the French captives.</p>

<p>Again war was resumed, and though there were negotiations for peace,
and even applications for missionaries, the French Government, weary of
being the sport of Indian treachery, resolved to humble the Iroquois.
Regular troops and a body of colonists were sent from Europe, and preparations
made for a vigorous war. Forts were erected on the Sorel River
and Lake Champlain to cover Canada and aid in operations against the
Mohawks and Oneidas. The western cantons, influenced by Garakonthié,
proposed peace, and their proposals were accepted. Then, in 1665, De
Courcelles led a force, on snow-shoes, to the very castles of the Mohawks,
and though the tribe was warned in time to escape, their flight had its effect
on the other cantons. The Oneidas asked for peace, and the Onondagas,
Cayugas, and Senecas renewed their request. De Tracy, the Viceroy
of Canada, led in person a force of twelve hundred French and one hundred
Indians to the Mohawk country, and laid it waste, burning all their
towns and destroying all their stores of provisions.</p>

<p>This exhibition of strength compelled the Mohawks to sue for peace.
All the cantons united in the treaty, and all solicited missionaries. Once
more were the Jesuits to undertake to propagate Christianity in the towns
of the Iroquois league, which had been so uniformly hostile to the French
and their allies. In July, 1667, Fathers Fremin, Bruyas, and Pierron set out
for the field of their mission work, trusting their lives to a Mohawk party.
They reached Gandawagué, and there and elsewhere found Christians. A
chapel in honor of St. Mary was raised, and Fremin, sending Bruyas to
Oneida, began his labors seriously. Pierron, after visiting Albany, returned
to Quebec, and in May, 1668, Onondaga was assigned to Father Julian Garnier.
Then De Carheil began St. Joseph’s mission at Cayuga; and Fremin,
leaving Pierron on the Mohawk, set out for the Seneca country to establish
a mission there.</p>

<p>Missionaries were thus at their labors in all the cantons, reviving the
faith of the captive Hurons, and winning the better disposed to the faith.
At Onondaga, Garakonthié during his life was the great stay of the missions.
He did not at once embrace Christianity; but after mature deliberation
was baptized with great solemnity in the cathedral of Quebec in
1669, and persevered to his death, respected by English, Dutch, and French,
and by the Indians of the Five Nations, as a man of remarkable ability
and virtue. The Mohawk canton gave to the faith Catharine Ganneaktena,
an Erie captive, who founded subsequently a mission village on the
St. Lawrence; Catharine Tehgahkwita, a Mohawk girl whom Canada reveres
to this day as a saint; the Chief Assendasé; and subsequently Kryn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
known as the Great Mohawk: Oneida gave the Chief Soenrese. Everywhere
the missionaries found hearers, and among them many with courage
enough to throw off the old ideas and accept Christianity with the strict
obligations it imposed. The liquor which was sold without check at
Albany made drunkenness prevalent throughout the castles of the Five
Nations, brutalizing the braves; and these degraded men became tools of
the medicine-men, who, clinging to the old belief, rallied around them the
old Pagan party. But it is a remarkable fact that the Jesuit missionaries,
while they did not succeed in making the Five Nations Christian, overthrew
the worship of Agreskoué, or Tharonhiawagon, their old divinity, so completely
that his name disappeared; and even those Iroquois who to this
day refuse to accept Christianity, nevertheless worship Niio or Hawenniio,
God or the Lord, who is no other than the God preached by the Jesuits
in their almost hopeless struggle in the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>The Christians in the cantons were subjected to so many annoyances and
petty persecutions, that gradually some sought homes with the Hurons at
Lorette; but when, in 1669, the Jesuits offered La Prairie de la Magdelaine,
a tract owned by them opposite Montreal, the Iroquois Christians began
there the mission of St. Francis Xavier. The opportunity of being free
from all molestation, of enjoying their religion in peace, led many to
emigrate from the castles in New York, and a considerable village grew up,
which the French fostered as a protection to Canada. This mission in time
was moved up to Sault St. Louis, and became the present village of Caughnawaga,
of which St. Regis is an offshoot. About the same time Iroquois
Christians gathered at the Sulpitian Mission of the Mountain formed a
village there beside that of the Algonquins, and this, removed to the Lake
of the Two Mountains, still subsists, the same church serving for the flock
divided in language.</p>

<p>These missions, continually recruited by accessions of converts from
New York, afforded the missionaries the best opportunity for improving
the Indians, and the spirit of religious fervor prevailed. The daily devotions,
the zeal and piety of these new Christians, won encomiums from the
bishop and clergy and from the civil authorities.</p>

<p>The sachems of the league saw with no favorable eye this emigration
which was building up Iroquois settlements in Canada; for at Quinté Bay,
Lake Ontario, was a third, chiefly of Cayugas, among whom the Sulpitians
became missionaries. Finding their own efforts to recall the emigrants
fruitless, the sachems complained to the English authorities. Dongan, the
able governor of New York, whose great object was to exclude the French
from the territory south of the great lakes, took up the matter in earnest.
He brought over English Jesuits to replace those of France in the missions
in the cantons from the Mohawk to Seneca Lake, and offered the Christian
Iroquois in Canada a tract at Saratoga, promising them a missionary and
special protection. The fall of James II. prevented the successful issue of
this plan; but the opposition made manifest in the English policy roused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
the old feeling in the Iroquois, and when De la Barre, and subsequently
Denonville, marched to attack the Iroquois, the missionaries, no longer
safe, abandoned their missions. John de
Lamberville, at Onondaga, was the last
of the missionaries, and he remained in
his chapel till news arrived that Denonville had seized many of the Iroquois
in order to send them to the galleys in France, and was advancing at the
head of an army. His life was forfeited, but the magnanimous sachems
would not punish him for the crime of another. They sent him safely back
under an escort.</p>

</div>

<p>Thus the Jesuit missions in New York ended virtually in 1687. Father
Milet, captured at Fort Frontenac, was a prisoner at Oneida from 1689
to 1694; and in spite of a severe law passed by New York in 1700, Bruyas,
the very next year, endeavored to revive the Iroquois missions; but they
never recovered any of their old importance, and were finally abandoned
in 1708, when the last Jesuit missionary retired to Albany. Thenceforth
the Jesuits devoted themselves to their mission at Sault St. Louis; though
at a later period the Sulpitian Picquet
gathered a new mission at the Presentation,
now Ogdensburg, in 1748.</p>

<div class="floatleft">

</div>

<p>During
the period of the main missions in
the tribes from 1668 to 1687, the baptisms&mdash;chiefly
of infants, and adults in danger of death&mdash;were about
two hundred and fifty a year in the Five Nations; no permanent church
or mission-house was erected, and the result of their teachings was the
only monument. This was not slight: many were sincere Christians, frequenting
Montreal and Philadelphia for the practice of their religion, while
the Moravian and other later missionaries found these converts, from a
knowledge of Christian thought and prayers, valuable auxiliaries in enabling
them to reach the heathen Iroquois. Pennsylvania, which had
English Jesuit missionaries in her borders, wisely employed their influence
to attract Catholic Iroquois to the chapel in Philadelphia, in order to win
through them the good-will of the cantons.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the Jesuit missions in New York, the Recollects
appeared within the Iroquois limits at Quinté Bay and Niagara, during La
Salle’s sway; but they made no serious effort to found a mission, though
Father Hennepin obtained Bruyas’ works on the Mohawk language, in
order to fit himself for the task. After the extinction of the Jesuits,
secular priests continued the missions at Sault St. Louis and St. Regis,
which still exist.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">The Ottawa Missions.</span>&mdash;In the geographical distribution of the
country, the district around Lake Superior acquired at an early period the
name of the country of the Ottawas, from the first tribe which opened
intercourse with the French. The Jesuits, after establishing their missions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
among the Hurons, soon extended their care to the neighboring Algonquin
tribes, and in 1641 Father Jogues and Father Raymbault visited the Chippewas
of Sault Ste. Marie. But the overthrow of the Wyandots and the
desertion of their country interrupted for years all intercourse between
the French on the St. Lawrence and the tribes on the upper lakes. Yet
in 1656 an Ottawa flotilla reached the St. Lawrence, and the missionaries
Garreau and Druillettes set out with them for the West; but near Montreal
Island they were ambushed by the Iroquois, and Garreau was left weltering
in his blood. Undeterred by his fate or by the hardships and perils of the
long journey, the aged Menard, a veteran of the Huron and Cayuga missions,
set out, encouraged by Bishop Laval, with another Ottawa flotilla, in
July, 1660, expecting no fate but one that would appall most men. “Should
we at last die of misery,” he wrote, “how great our happiness will be!”
Paddling all day, compelled to bear heavy burdens, deprived of food,
and even abandoned by his brutal Ottawa guides, Menard at last reached
a bay on the southern shore of Lake Superior on the festival of St. Teresa,
and named it in her honor. It was apparently Keweenaw Bay. “Here,”
he wrote, “I had the consolation of saying mass, which repaid me with
usury for all my past hardships. Here I began a mission, composed of a
flying church of Christian Indians from the neighborhood of the settlements,
and of such as God’s mercy has gathered in here.” A chief at first
received him into his wigwam, but soon drove him out; and the aged priest
made a rude shelter of fir branches piled up, and in this passed the winter
laboring to instruct and console some as wretched as himself. In the
spring his zeal led him to respond to a call from some fugitive Hurons
who were far inland. He set out, but was lost at a portage, and in all
probability was murdered by a Kickapoo, in August, 1661.</p>

<p>Claude Allouez was the next Jesuit assigned to this dangerous post. In
the summer of 1665 he set out, and reaching Chegoimegon Bay on Lake
Superior on the first of October, began the mission of La Pointe du St.
Esprit, content to labor there alone with no mission station and no countrymen
except a few fur-traders between his chapel and Montreal. For thirty
years he went from tribe to tribe endeavoring to plant the faith of which
he was the envoy. He founded the mission at Sault Ste. Marie, those in
Green Bay, the Miami, and, with Marquette, the Illinois mission. He was
the first of the missionaries to meet the Sioux and to announce the existence
of the great river Mesipi. His first labors were among the Chippewas
at Sault Ste. Marie, the Ottawas at La Pointe, and the Nipissings at Lake
Alimpegon. When reinforced by Fathers Nicolas, Marquette, and Dablon,
the last two took post at Sault Ste. Marie; and Allouez, leaving the Ottawa
mission to Father Marquette, who soon had the Hurons also gather around
him at La Pointe, proceeded to Green Bay, where he founded, in December,
1669, the mission of St. Francis Xavier and a motley village of Sacs
and Foxes, Pottawatamies, and Winnebagoes. His visits soon extended
to other towns on the bay and on Fox River.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>At these missions the Jesuits, after their daily mass, remained for a time
to instruct all who came; then they visited the cabins to comfort the sick,
and to baptize infants in danger of death. Study of the dialects of the
various tribes cost hours of patient toil; and reaching the western limit
of the Algonquin tribes, they were already in contact with the Winnebagoes
and Sioux of a radically different stock,&mdash;the Dakota.</p>

<p>Marquette was preparing the way to the lodges of the Sioux, when the
folly of the Hurons and Ottawas provoked that tribe to war. The Hurons
fled to Mackinac, the Ottawas to Manitouline, and Marquette was compelled
to defer his projected Sioux and Illinois missions.</p>

<p>The field seemed full of promise, and other missionaries were sent out.
They labored amid great hardships, and suffered much from the brutality
of the Indians. With tribes that were constantly shifting their camping-grounds,
it was difficult to maintain any regular system of instruction for
adults, or to bring the young to frequent the chapel with any assiduity.
Lay brothers, skilled as smiths and workers in metal, were powerful auxiliaries
in winning the good-will of the Indians, as they repaired guns and
other weapons and utensils. They were the first manufacturers of the
West, visiting the copper deposits of Lake Superior, to obtain material
for crucifixes, medals, and other similar objects, which the missionaries
distributed among their converts. Yet even these lay brothers and their
helpers, the volunteer <i>donnés</i>, were not free from danger, and tradition
claims that one of them was killed by the brutal men whom they had so
long served so well.</p>

<p>Of these missions, that at Mackinac, with its Hurons and Ottawas,
became the largest and most fervent. The former were more easily recalled
to their long-forgotten Christian duties, and the Ottawas benefited by their
example. Between 1670 and 1680 this mission, then at Point St. Ignace,
numbered five hundred Hurons and thirteen hundred Ottawas.</p>

<p>The missions at Green Bay could show much less progress among the
Sacs and Foxes, Mascoutens, Pottawatamies, and Menomonees.</p>

<p>Father Marquette, setting out in June, 1673, from Mackinac with Louis
Jolliet, ascended the Fox, and reaching the Wisconsin by a portage, entered
the Mississippi, which they descended to the villages of the Quappas or
Arkansas. Returning by way of the Illinois River, the Jesuit gave the
Kaskaskias the first instructions, and was so encouraged that he returned to
found a mission, but died before he could reach his chapel at Mackinac.
This Illinois mission was continued by Allouez, who visited it regularly for
several years from his headquarters among the Miamis.</p>

<p>There had arisen by this time a strong government opposition to the
Jesuits, based partly on a hostility to the order which had always prevailed
in France, but heightened in Canada by the fact that in the struggle between
the civil authorities and the bishop with his clergy in regard to the
selling of liquor to the Indians, the Jesuits were regarded as the most stanch
and active adherents of the bishop. This feeling led to the recall of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
Recollects. They found, however, few avenues for their labors. Several
were assigned to Cavelier de la Salle, to accompany him on his explorations.
One was stationed at Fort Frontenac, and Father Hennepin made some attempt
to acquire a knowledge of Iroquois; but no mission work is recorded
there or at Niagara, where Father Watteau was left.</p>

<p>Father Gabriel de la Ribourde, with Hennepin and Zenobius Membré,
proceeded westward, and when La Salle established his post on the Illinois,
which he called Fort Crèvecœur, the three Franciscans attempted a mission.
Then Father Zenobius took up his residence in an Illinois wigwam. He
found great difficulty, and was not destined to continue the experiment long.
Hennepin, sent off by La Salle, descended to the Mississippi, and fell into the
hands of the Sioux, who carried him up to the falls which still bear the
name he conferred, “St. Anthony’s.” He was rescued after a time by Du
Lhut, but can scarcely be said to have founded a mission. The Iroquois
drove the French from Fort Crèvecœur by their attack on the Illinois,
Father Gabriel was killed on the march by wandering Indians, and the
attempted Recollect mission closed. After La Salle’s descent of the Mississippi
and departure from the west, Allouez resumed his labors in Illinois,
and was followed by Gravier, who placed the mission on a solid basis, and
reduced the language to grammatical rules. Binneteau, the Marests, Mermet,
and Pinet came to join in the good work. The Illinois seemed to
show greater docility than did the tribes on Lake Superior and Green Bay.
The missionaries were stationed among the Kaskaskias, Cahokias, Peorias,
and Tamaroas. French settlements grew up in the fertile district, and marriages
with converted Indian women were not uncommon. These missions
flourished for several years, and a monument of the zeal of the Jesuits exists
in a very extensive and elaborate dictionary of the language, with catechism
and prayers, apparently the work of Father le Boulanger.</p>

<p>When Iberville reached the mouth of the Mississippi he was accompanied
by Jesuit Fathers; but at that time no regular mission was attempted
at the mouth of the river.</p>

<p>The Seminary of Quebec resolved to enter the wide field opened by the
discovery of the Mississippi. Under the authority of the Bishop of Quebec,
the Rev. Francis de Montigny, the Rev. Messrs. St. Côme and Davion
were sent to Louisiana in 1698. They took charge of the Tamaroa mission
on the Illinois, and attempted missions among the Natchez, Taensas,
and Tonicas; but the Rev. Mr. St. Côme, who was stationed at Natchez, and
the Rev. Mr. Foncault were killed by roving Indians. Then the priests of
the Quebec Seminary withdrew from the lower Mississippi, but continued
to labor at Tamaroa, chiefly for the French, till the closing years of French
rule.</p>

<p>The Indian missions of Louisiana were then assigned to the Jesuits, who
were allowed to have a residence in New Orleans, but were excluded from
all ministry among the colonists. Their principal missions, among the Arkansas,
Yazoos, Choctaws, and Alibamons were continued till the suppression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
of the order. At the time of the Natchez outbreak, the Jesuit Father du
Poisson, who had stopped at the post to give the settlers the benefit of his
ministry in the absence of their priest, was involved in the massacre; Father
Souel was butchered by the Yazoos whom he was endeavoring to convert,
and Father Doutreleau escaped in a most marvellous manner. In the subsequent
operations of the French against the Chickasaws, Father Sénat, accompanying
a force of French and Illinois as chaplain, was taken and put to
death at the stake, heroically refusing to abandon the wounded and dying.</p>

<p>These Louisiana missions extended to the country of the Sioux, where
several attempts were made by Father Guignas, who was long a prisoner,
and by other Jesuit Fathers. Aubert died by the hands of the Indians
while trying to reach and cross the Rocky Mountains with La Verenderye.</p>

<p>The increasing hostility to the Jesuits naturally weakened their missions,
which received a death-blow from the suppression of the order in France,&mdash;a
step carried out so vindictively in Louisiana, that all the churches at
their Indian missions were ordered to be razed to the ground.</p>

<p>As Canada fell to England and Louisiana to Spain, the work of the
Jesuit missionaries in French North America ended. Their record is a
chapter of American history full of personal devotedness, energy, courage,
and perseverance; none can withhold the homage of respect to men like
Jogues, Brebeuf, Garnier, Buteux, Gravier, Allouez, and Marquette. Men of
intelligence and education, they gave up all that civilized life can offer to
share the precarious life of wandering savages, and were the first to reveal
the character of the interior of the country, its soil and products, the life
and ideas of the natives, and the system of American languages. They
made known the existence of salt springs in New York, and of copper on
Lake Superior; they identified the ginseng, and enabled France to open a
lucrative trade in it with China; they planted the first wheat in Illinois and
the first sugar in Louisiana. Their missions did not equal in results those of
the Franciscans in Florida, Texas, New Mexico, and California,&mdash;not from
any lack of personal ability or devotion to their work, but because they were
at the mercy of trading companies, which allowed them a stipend just sufficing
for their moderate wants; but neither company nor government made
any outlay for such mission-work as would have enabled the missionaries to
carry out any general plan for civilizing the natives. The Spanish Government,
on the contrary, dealt directly with the missionaries, and did all to
insure the success of their teaching. When a mission was to be established
in Texas, New Mexico, or California, with the missionaries went a party of
soldiers to erect a <i>presidio</i> or garrison-house as the nucleus of a settlement.
These soldiers took their families with them; civilized Indians from Mexico
who had acquired some European arts and trades were also sent, as being
able to understand the character of the Indians better. With the party
went horses, cattle, sheep, swine, agricultural implements, grain and seeds
for planting, looms, etc. Then a mission was established, and as converts
were made in the neighboring tribes, they were brought into the mission,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
and there taught to read and write in Spanish, instructed religiously, and
trained to agriculture and trades. The mission was under discipline like a
large factory, and each family shared in the profit.</p>

<p>The defect of the system was that no provision was made for the gradual
settling apart from the mission of those who showed ability and judgment,
allowing them to manage for themselves, and replacing them by
others. They were kept too long in the degree of vassals, with no incentive
to acquire manhood and independence. Accordingly, when the
missions were suppressed, the Indians, who had never acted for themselves,
were left in a state of helplessness.</p>

<p>Such a system in Canada would have saved the Indians of the St. Lawrence
Valley and Upper Canada. What was accomplished, was effected by
the indomitable energy of individuals,&mdash;the Jesuits, laboring most earnestly
and continuously, effecting most; the Sulpitians ranking next;
then the Priests of the Foreign Missions, and the Recollects. In our time
the work of winning the Indians to the Catholic faith, or retaining them
among its adherents, has devolved almost entirely on the Oblates of Mary
Immaculate in Canada and Oregon, the Jesuits and Benedictines in the
United States.</p>

<h3><a name="c290" id="c290"></a>CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE works bearing directly or mainly on the history of the Catholic missions in Canada
and the other parts of the northern continent once claimed by France embrace so
large a collection, that, instead of the missions being an incident in the civil history, the
civil history of French America for much of its first century has to be gleaned from the
annals of its missionary work.</p>

<p>For the first Recollect mission,&mdash;1615-1629,&mdash;the main authority is Sagard, <i>Le Grand
Voyage du Pays des Hurons, situé en l’Amérique vers la Mer douce, és derniers confins de
la Nouvelle France, dite Canada</i>, Paris, Denys Moreau, 1632; enlarged a few years
later, and published as <i>Histoire du Canada et Voyages que les Frères Mineurs Recollects
y ont faicts pour la conversion des infidelles</i>, Paris, Claude Sonnius, 1636. To each of
these works is appended a <i>Dictionnaire de la Langve Hvronne</i>, Paris, 1632. Sagard’s
work is very diffuse, rich in details on Indian life and customs, but gives little as to the
civil history of Canada.<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>Le Clercq, <i>Établissement de la Foi</i>, 2 vols. 12mo, 1691, translated as <i>Establishment
of the Faith</i>, 2 vols. 8vo, New York, 1881,<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> gives in the first volume a clearer and more
definite account of the ecclesiastical history of Canada for the period embraced in the first
Recollect mission.</p>

<p>The <i>Voyages de Champlain</i>, Paris, 1619, gives some account of the introduction of the
Recollects into Canada.<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> In Margry, <i>Découvertes et Établissements des Français</i>, Paris,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
1875, there are two memoirs by the Recollects, drawn up to obtain permission to return to
Canada,&mdash;one made in 1637 (vol. i. p. 3), the other in 1684 (p. 18),&mdash;both bearing on their
earlier labors.</p>

<p>Le Clercq refers in two places<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> to “an ample Relation given to the public” by the
Recollects of Aquitaine for an account of their labors in Acadia; but the work is still
unknown to bibliographers and students.</p>

<p>For the later Recollect missions, the sources to be consulted are Father Christian
Le Clercq, <i>Nouvelle Relation de la Gaspésie</i>, Paris, 1691, and the second volume of his
<i>Établissement de la Foi</i>. Hennepin, in his <i>Description de la Louisiane</i>, Paris, 1683, 1688,
translated as <i>Description of Louisiana</i>, New York, 1881, gives an account of his own missionary
career; but his <i>Nouvelle Découverte</i> expands his former work, and introduces
matter of doubtful authenticity, while his <i>Nouveau Voyage</i> is based on the second volume
of Le Clercq.<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a></p>

<p>As bearing on the Recollect missions, cf. the <i>Voyage au Nouveau Monde</i> of Father
Crespel, Amsterdam, 1757; in English in <i>Perils of the Ocean and Wilderness</i>, Boston.<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a></p>

<p class="p2">On the Jesuit missions, the works to be consulted are, for the first attempt in Acadia,
Biard, <i>Relation de la Nouvelle France, de ses Terres, Naturel des Terres, et de ses Habitans</i>,
Lyons, 1616, reprinted in the <i>Relations des Jésuites</i>, Quebec, 1858, and in fac-simile by Dr.
O’Callaghan; the accounts in the <i>Annuæ Litteræ Societatis Jesu</i> for 1612, Lyons, 1618,
and for 1611, Douay, 1618; Biard’s letter in Carayon’s <i>Première Mission des Jésuites au
Canada</i>, pp. 1-105; and an adverse view in Lescarbot, <i>Histoire de la Nouvelle France</i>,
3d ed., Paris, 1618.</p>

<p>For the missions of Canada proper, the series of <i>Jesuit Relations</i>, as they are generally
called, volumes issued in Paris, beginning with the “Lettre du Père Charles l’Allemant,”
Paris, 1627 (also vol. xiii. of the <i>Mercure Français</i>), as <i>Relation de ce qui s’est passé en la
Nouvelle France en l’année MDCXXVI</i>, and continued annually from the <i>Briève Relation
du Voyage de la Nouvelle France</i>, by Father Paul le Jeune, printed by Cramoisy at Paris in
1632, down to the year 1672, comprising in all a series of forty-one volumes. Besides the
religious information which it was their main object to convey, in order to interest the pious
in France in their mission work, the Jesuits in these <i>Relations</i> give much information as
to the progress of geographical discovery, the resources and fauna of the country, the Indian
nations, their language, manners, and customs, their wars and vicissitudes. The volumes
have been much sought by collectors, and the whole series was reprinted by the Canadian
Government at Quebec in 1858, in three large octavo volumes, under the title of <i>Relations
des Jésuites</i>. Though some <i>Relations</i> were reprinted and translated into Latin, complete
sets have never been common. In Le Clercq’s <i>Établissement de la Foi</i> there is a bitter
and satirical review of these Jesuit <i>Relations</i>, but the writer evidently had only eight or
nine of the volumes; and Arnauld, the great enemy of the Jesuits, having his attention
drawn to them by Le Clercq’s work, found great difficulty in getting copies of any, but
finally discovered fourteen in “a great library.” Dr. E. B. O’Callaghan drew attention
to them in a paper before the New York Historical Society, and several collectors endeavored
to complete sets. Mr. James Lenox obtained nearly all, reprinting two that exist in
almost unique copies. Matter was prepared for subsequent volumes by the Superiors of
the Canada missions, and the <i>Relations</i> for 1672-73, 1675, 1673-79, 1696, and separate
<i>Relations</i> bearing on the Abenaki, Illinois, and Louisiana missions have been printed
to correspond with the old <i>Relations</i>; and many of these were reprinted under the title
of <i>Relations Inédites de la Nouvelle France</i>, 2 vols., 12mo, Paris, 1861. The autobiography
of the missionary Chaumonot has also been issued (New York, 1858; Paris, 1869);
and <i>Lives of Father Isaac Jogues and Brebeuf</i>, by Father Felix Martin (Paris, 1873,
etc.). One work called forth by the Jesuit missions in Canada is the <i>Mœurs des Sauvages
Amériquains comparées dux mœurs des premiers Temps</i>, by Father Lafitau, long a missionary
at Sault St. Louis, and author also of a treatise on the Ginseng.<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a></p>

<p>For the Louisiana mission there are some letters in the <i>Lettres Édifiantes</i>, which are
also given in Rt. Rev. W. I. Kip, <i>Early Jesuit Missions in North America</i>, New York,
1847. The close of that mission is described in Carayon, <i>Bannissement des Jésuites de la
Louisiane</i>, Paris, 1865. Besides the works in French, there is a <i>Breve Relatione d’alcune
Missione</i>, by Father Joseph Bressani, a Huron missionary captured and tortured by the
Mohawks. It appeared at Macerata in 1653, and a French translation of it by F. Félix
Martin was issued in Montreal in 1852. The work of Du Creux, <i>Historia Canadensis</i>, Paris,
1664, gives a summary of the mission work of the Jesuits in Canada. Father Marquette’s
account of his voyage down the Mississippi was first printed by Thevenot, <i>Recueil de Voyages</i>,
Paris, 1681, and was translated into Dutch and issued by Vander Aa. It was
printed from the original manuscript by Mr. James Lenox,&mdash;<i>Récit des Voyages et des
Descouvertes du R. Père Jacques Marquette</i>,&mdash;and had been previously translated and
published by J. G. Shea in his <i>Discovery and Exploration of the Mississippi Valley</i>,
New York, 1852.</p>

<p class="p2">The history of the Sulpitian missions is to be found chiefly in recent works: Faillon,
<i>Histoire de la Colonie Française en Canada</i>, 3 vols., Montreal, 1854; <i>Vie de la Sœur
Bourgeoys</i>, 1853; <i>Vie de Mlle. Mance</i>, 2 vols., 1854. Belmont, <i>Histoire du Canada</i>,
Quebec, 1840; Dollier de Casson, <i>Histoire de Montreal</i>, Montreal, 1869; and <i>Voyage de
MM. Dollier et Galinée</i>, Montreal, 1875, are printed from manuscripts of early missionaries
of that body.</p>

<p>Of the missions founded by the Seminary of Quebec nothing has been printed except
the <i>Relation de la Mission du Mississippi du Séminaire de Québec en</i> 1700, New York,
1861. The vast and successful Spanish missions, extending from the Chesapeake to the
Gulf of California, have a literature of their own, of which it is not our province to treat.</p>

that no library (1870-71) has a complete set of
the <i>Jesuit Relations</i>; and adds that, including
those of 1616 and 1627, a full set consists of
fifty-four volumes, nine of which are second editions,
and one a Latin translation. He had
inspected all but one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. B. O’Callaghan</span>: a catalogue raisonnée
(1632-1672), in the <i>N. Y. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, 1847,
p. 140, also printed separately. Field (<i>Indian
Bibliography</i>, no. 1,146), in noticing this essay,
says that Dr. O’Callaghan enumerates only forty
titles, of which the Carter-Brown Collection had
thirty-six; Harvard College, thirty-five; Henry
C. Murphy, twenty-nine. “Of the forty-eight
now [1873] known to exist, Mr. Murphy has secured
all but three.” Dr. O’Callaghan at that
time named twenty libraries, public and private,
in the United States which had sets more or
less imperfect. The volumes of some years
were not very scarce, those of 1648-1649 and
1653-1654 being known in ten copies in these
libraries, while there were at that time no copies
at all of the years 1655 and 1659; and these,
marked by titles varying from the usual form,
are still the rarest of the series.</p>

<p>The O’Callaghan pamphlet was reissued at
Montreal in 1850 in a French translation by
Father Martin, the superior of the Jesuits in
Canada, who amended the text in places, and
included the Biard <i>Relation</i> of 1613. He also
gave an account of unprinted ones still preserved
in Canada which were written subsequent
to 1672, when the annual printing of them
ceased.</p>

<p>Deriving help from this and other sources,
Dr. O’Callaghan issued privately, in 1853, a
broadside, with an amended list of the <i>Relations</i>
and their several principal repositories,&mdash;State
Library, Albany; Harvard College Library; the
Parliamentary Library, Quebec; and the private
libraries of Mr. Carter-Brown of Providence,
Mr. Lenox of New York, Rev. Mr. Plante, Mr.
O. H. Marshall of Buffalo, and Mr. George
Bancroft.</p>

<p>In June, 1870, Dr. O’Callaghan issued a circular
asking information of owners of the volumes
for a second edition of his tract; but I
cannot learn that the new edition was ever published.
At the sale of Dr. O’Callaghan’s library
December, 1882, his <i>Catalogue</i>, p. 105, showed 31
of the series; and they brought $1,068.45. Dr.
O’Callaghan contributed a paper on the <i>Relations
to the International Magazine</i>, iii. 185.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lenox Library</span>: <i>Contributions</i>, no. ii., <i>The
Jesuit Relation</i>, etc., New York, 1879. The <i>Relation</i>
of 1659, of which the copy in the Library
of the Canadian Parliament was supposed to
be unique, was reprinted in fac-simile by Mr.
Lenox. In 1854, at the destruction of the Parliamentary
Library at Montreal, its series of
these <i>Relations</i>, forty-three in number (except
eight), and including this unique volume, was
destroyed. This <i>Contribution</i> shows the Lenox
Library to possess forty-nine out of the series
of fifty-five, counting different editions of the
forty-one titles, from 1632 to 1672, making the
fifty-five to include two translations and twelve
second or later editions. The Lenox series
lacks nos. 1, 28, and 35, as enumerated, and of
no. 35 the Carter-Brown Library has the only
copy known in America. The Lenox Library
also lacks the first issue of no. 2, and the second
issue of nos. 3 and 5. It has four duplicates,
with slight variations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>These <i>Relations</i> will also be found entered
under their respective authors in Sabin’s <i>Dictionary</i>
and in Field’s <i>Indian Bibliography</i>.</p>

<p class="p2">The reason of the rarity of these books
may lie in part in the smallness of the editions,
but probably most in the avidity of readers, and
consequent destruction; for Charlevoix says,
“They were at the time extremely relished in
France.” Of their character, the same authority
says: “There is no other source to which
we can apply for instruction as to the progress
of religion among the savages, or for a knowledge
of these people, all of whose languages the
Jesuits spoke. The style of these <i>Relations</i> is
extremely simple; but this simplicity itself has
not contributed less to give them a great celebrity
than the curious and edifying matter they
contain.” Father Martin, in his translation
of Bressani, speaks (p. 8) Of these <i>Relations</i>
as the most precious monument, and sometimes
the only source, of the history of Canada, and
praises the impartial use made of them by Bancroft
and Sparks. Parkman says of them:
“Though the productions of men of scholastic
training, they are simple and often crude in
style, as might be expected of narratives hastily
written in Indian lodges or rude mission-houses
in the forest, amid annoyances and interruptions
of all kinds. In respect to the value of their
contents, they are exceedingly unequal.... The
closest examination has left me no doubt that
these missionaries wrote in perfect good faith,
and that the <i>Relations</i> hold a high place as authentic
and trustworthy historical documents.
They are very scarce, and no complete collection
of them exists in America.” Shea (<i>Le
Clercq</i>, i. 381) has a note of the contemporary
discrediting of the <i>Relations</i> by rival orders.</p>

<p>The series was reprinted by the Canadian
Government in 1858 in three octavo volumes,
with bibliographical notes and synopses, containing&mdash;vol.
i. 1611, 1626, 1632 to 1641; ii.
1642 to 1655; iii. 1656 to 1672. These reprinted
volumes are not now easy to find, and have been
lately priced at £7 10<i>s.</i> and 100 francs. Field,
<i>Indian Bibliography</i>, no. 1,177; Lenox, <i>Jesuit
Relations</i>, p. 14.</p>

<p>There have been three supplemental and
complemental issues of allied and later <i>Relations</i>;
one was printed at the expense of Mr.
Lenox, and the others had the editorial care of
Dr. O’Callaghan and Dr. Shea, of which notice
will be taken under their respective dates. See
the lists of Shea’s “Cramoisy Series” (100
copies printed) in the <i>Lenox Contributions</i>, p.
15; Field, <i>Indian Bibliography</i>, nos. 129 and
1,397; and <i>Menzies Catalogue</i>, no. 1,811; and
the <i>O’Callaghan Catalogue</i> for Dr. O’Callaghan’s
series (25 copies printed). Dr. Shea’s acquaintance
with the subject was first largely evinced
by his <i>History of the Catholic Missions among the
Indian Tribes of the United States</i>, 1529-1854,
published, at the instance of Jared Sparks, in
New York in 1855 (Field, no. 1,392); and he
published a list of early missionaries among the
Iroquois in the <i>Documentary History of New
York</i>, iv. 189.</p>

<p>The earliest summarizing of these <i>Relations</i>
or of those before 1656, was by the Père du
Creux (or Creuxius, b. 1596, d. 1666) in his <i>Historiæ
Canadensis, sev Novæ Franciæ, libri decem</i>,
Paris, 1664 (pp. xxvi, 810, 4, map and thirteen
plates). There are copies in Harvard College,
Carter-Brown, Lenox, and New York Historical
Society libraries. Cf. Rich (1832), no. 333,

p. 10; O’Callaghan, no. 699; Huth, i. 367; Sunderland,
vol. ii. no. 3,561; Charlevoix (Shea’s edition),
i. 81, who says: “This extremely diffuse
work was composed almost exclusively from the
Jesuit <i>Relations</i>. Father du Creux did not reflect
that details read with pleasure in a letter
become unsupportable in a continuous history.”
“It contains, however,” says Dr. Shea, “some
curious statements, showing that he had other
material.” The map, <i>Tabula Novæ Franciæ
anno 1660</i>, extends so as to include Hudson’s
Bay, Newfoundland, the Chesapeake, and Lake
Superior; and it has a corner-map, “Pars regionis
Huronum hodie desertæ.” The map has
been reproduced in Martin’s translation of Bressani’s
<i>Relation</i> of 1653, and is given in part on
another page of the present volume.</p>

<p>The <i>Relations</i> were not much noticed by
writers at the time, and few allusions to them
appear in contemporaneous works. One of the
few books which drew largely from them is <i>Le
Nouveau Monde ou l’Amérique Chrestienne....
Par M<sup>e</sup> Charles Chavlmer, Historiographe de
France</i>. Paris, 1659.</p>

<p>The story of the missions of New France
necessarily makes part of the general works of
Charlevoix and the other Catholic historians,
particularly the <i>Histoire du Canada</i> of Brasseur
de Bourbourg, Paris, 1859, who depends largely
upon Bancroft for his facts. Mr. Parkman, not
bound by the same ties, gives a view of the
Jesuits’ character, in his <i>Jesuits in North America</i>,
which has been questioned by their adherents.
His book, however, is of the first
importance; and Dr. George E. Ellis, in the
<i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, September, 1867, recounts, in
a review of the book, the historian’s physical
disability, which has from the beginning of his
labor sadly impeded the progress of his work.
Cf. also Dr. Ellis’s sustained estimate of Parkman,
in his <i>Red Man and White Man in North
America</i>, p. 259. The story of the Jesuits’ trials
contained in the <i>Lettres Edifiantes</i> is translated
in Bishop W. I. Kip’s <i>Early Jesuit Missions in
North America</i>, 1846, and again, 1866. Cf. also
<i>Magazine of American History</i>, iii. 767; M. J.
Griffin in <i>Canadian Monthly</i>, i. 344; W. B. O.
Peabody’s “Early Jesuit Missionaries in the
Northwest,” in <i>Democratic Review</i>, May, 1844,
reprinted in Beach’s <i>Indian Miscellany</i>; Judge
Law on the same subject, in <i>Wisconsin Historical
Society’s Collections</i>, iii. 89; and Thébaud on
the natives and the missions, in <i>The Month</i>,
June, 1877; Poole’s <i>Index</i> gives other references,
p. 683. Dr. Shea, at the end of his <i>Catholic
Missions</i>, p. 503, gives a list of his sources
printed and in manuscript.</p>

<p>Of the tribes encountered by the Jesuits,
there is no better compact account than Mr.
Parkman gives in the Introduction to his <i>Jesuits
in North America</i>, where he awards (p. liv) well-merited
praise to Lewis H. Morgan’s <i>League
of the Iroquois</i>, and qualified commendation to
Schoolcraft’s <i>Notes on the Iroquois</i>, and gives
(p. lxxx) a justly severe judgment on his <i>Indian
Tribes</i>. Mr. Parkman’s Introduction first appeared
in the <i>North American Review</i>, 1865
and 1866.</p>

<p>This sketch follows one by Mr. C. C. Baldwin, accompanying an article on “Early Indian Migrations in
Ohio,” in the <i>American Antiquarian</i>, i. 228 (reprinted in <i>Western Reserve Historical Society’s Tracts</i>, no. 47),
in which he conjecturally places the position of the tribes occupying that valley at the opening of the seventeenth
century. The key is as follows: 1, Ottawas; 2, Wyandots and Hurons: 3, Neutrals; 4, Iroquois;
5, Eries; 6, Andastes, or Susquehannahs; 7, Algonquins; 8, Cherokees; 9, Shawnees; 10, Miamies; 11, Illinois;
12, Arkansas; 13, Cherokees. (On the Andastes see Hawley’s <i>Cayuga History</i>, p. 36.)</p>

<p>There is another map of the position of the Indians in 1600 in George Gale’s <i>Upper Mississippi</i>, Chicago,
1867, p. 49; and Dr. Edward Eggleston gives one of wider scope in the <i>Century Magazine</i>, May, 1883, p. 98.
Cf. Henry Harvey’s <i>History of the Shawnee Indians</i>, 1681-1854, Cincinnati, 1855; and a paper by D. G.
Brinton on the Shawnees and their migrations, in the <i>Historical Magazine</i>, x. 21. Judge M. F. Force, in <i>Some
Early Notices of the Indians of Ohio</i>, Cincinnati, 1879, an address before the Philosophical and Historical
Society of Ohio, has tracked the changing habitations of the tribes of that region. There is a paper by S. D.
Peet on the location of the Indian tribes between the Ohio and the Lakes, in the <i>American Antiquarian</i>, i. 85.
William H. Harrison controverted the view that the Iroquois ever conquered the valley of the Ohio, in his
“Discourse on the Aborigines of the Valley of the Ohio,” which was printed at Cincinnati in 1838, at Boston
in 1840, and in the Historical and Philosophical Society of Ohio’s <i>Transactions</i>, vol. i. part 2d, p. 217; but
compare C. C. Baldwin’s “Iroquois in Ohio, and the Destruction of the Eries,” in <i>Western Reserve Historical
Society’s Tracts</i>, no. 40. David Cusick (a Tuscarora) published <i>Sketches of Ancient History of the Six
Nations</i>, at Tuscarora Village, 1825, and again at Lockport, N. Y., 1848. An historical sketch of the Wyandots
will be found in the <i>Historical Magazine</i>, v. 263; and Peter Clarke (a Wyandot) has published the <i>Origin and
Traditional History of the Wyandots</i>. See references in Poole’s Index under Hurons, Iroquois, Indians, etc.]</p>

<p>There is a rare book containing contemporary
accounts of the savages, which was written
at Three Rivers in 1663, by the governor of that
place, the Sieur Pierre Boucher, and published
in Paris in 1664, under the title, <i>Histoire veritable
et naturelle des Mœurs et Productions du
Pays de la Nouvelle France, vulgairement dite le
Canada</i>. The author, says Charlevoix (Shea’s
edition, i. p. 80), should
not be confounded
with the Jesuit of the
same name; and he
calls the book under
consideration a “superficial
but faithful
account of Canada.”
There are copies in the
Harvard College, Lenox
(<i>Jesuit Relations</i>,
p. 10), and Carter-Brown
(<i>Catalogue</i> ii.
941) libraries.<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a></p>

<p>Another early account
is the <i>Mémoire
sur les Mœurs ... des
Sauvages</i>, by Nicholas
Perrot, which remained
in manuscript till it
was edited by Father
Tailhan, and printed in
1864.<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a></p>

<p>The Jesuit Lafitau
published at Paris in
1724 his <i>Mœurs des Sauvages Amériquains</i> in
two volumes, with various plates, which in the
main is confined to the natives of Canada, where
he had lived long with
the Iroquois. Charlevoix
said of his book,
twenty years later, “We
have nothing so exact upon the subject;” and
Lafitau continues to hold high rank as an original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
authority, though his book is overlaid with
a theory of the Tartaric origin of the red race.
Mr. Parkman calls him the most satisfactory
of the elder writers. (Field, no. 850; Carter-Brown,
vol. iii. nos. 344, 345, 472; Sabin, vol. x.
p. 22.) There was a Dutch version, with the
same plates, in 1731.</p>

<p>Bacqueville de la Potherie’s <i>Histoire de l’Amérique
Septentrionale</i>, in four volumes, with a distinctive
title to each (1722 and 1753), is mainly
a history of the Indians with which the French
came in contact. He wrote early in the last
century, and his book saw several editions,
evincing the interest it created. His information
is at second hand for the early portions
of the period covered (since Cartier);
but of the later times he becomes a contemporary
authority. (Field, no. 66,)</p>

<p>Of less interest in relation to the seventeenth
century is Le Beau’s <i>Voyage Curieux et Nouveau
parmi les Sauvages de l’Amérique Septentrionale</i>,
published at Amsterdam in 1738,&mdash;a work,
however, of a semi-historical character, (Field,
no. 901.)</p>

<p>Cadwallader Colden’s <i>History of the Five
Indian Nations</i> was printed by Bradford in New
York in 1727, and is now very rare. Dr. Shea
reprinted it in 1866, and in his introduction and
notes its somewhat curious bibliographical history
is learnedly traced. (Carter-Brown, vol.
iii. nos. 393, 394; Field, <i>Indian Bibliography</i>,
341; Menzies, 429, $210; Sabin, vol. v. p. 222.)
The three later London editions (1747, 1750,
1755) were altered somewhat by the English
publishers, without indicating the variations they
introduced. (Carter-Brown, vol. iii. nos. 847,
922, 1,049.) A portrait of Colden is given in
the <i>Historical Magazine</i>, ix. 1. Sulte, in his
<i>Mélanges</i>, p. 184, has an essay on the respective
positions of the Iroquois and Algonquins previous
to the coming of the Europeans.</p>

<p>D. G. Brinton, at the end of chap. i. of his
<i>Myths of the New World</i>, characterizes the different
writers on the mythologies of the Indians;
and Mr. Parkman, <i>Jesuits</i>, etc., p. lxxxviii, notes
some of the repositories of Iroquois legends.</p>

<p>A valuable paper on the origin of the Iroquois
confederacy, by Horatio Hale, is printed
in <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, xix. 241; and Mr. C.
C. Baldwin has a paper on the Iroquois in Ohio
in the <i>Western Reserve Historical Society</i>, no. 40,
and another paper on the early Indian migrations,
in no. 47. Mr. Hale has further extended
our knowledge by the curious learning of his
<i>Iroquois Book of Rites</i>, Cincinnati, 1883; and he
also printed in the <i>American Antiquarian</i>, January
and April, 1883 (also separately Chicago,
1883), a scholarly paper on <i>Indian Migrations as
evidenced by Language</i>.</p>

<p>So far as relates to the more easterly tribes
coming within the range of the Jesuits’ influence,
Parkman’s description can be compared with the
plain matter-of-fact enumerations which make up
the picture in Palfrey’s <i>New England</i>, which are
derived from authorities enumerated in his notes.
See various papers in the <i>Canadian Journal</i>.</p>

<p>The general historians of New France necessarily
give more or less attention to the study
of the Indians as the Jesuits found them; and
such a study is an integral part of Dr. George
E. Ellis’s learned monograph, <i>The Red Man and
the White Man in North America</i>, whose account
of the different methods of converting the natives,
pursued by the French and the English,
may be compared with that in Archbishop
Spalding’s <i>Miscellanea</i>, i. 333.</p>

         <p class="pf250">Faillon, <i>Histoire de la Colonie Française</i>, iii. 375, gives a map of Montreal preserved in the French
archives,&mdash;<i>Plan de Villemarie et des premières rues projetées pour l’établissement de la Haute Ville</i>. This
represents the town at about 1665. There is a fac-simile of another plan of about 1680 preserved in the
library of the Canadian Parliament, the original being at Paris (<i>Catalogue</i>, 1858, p. 1,615). A plan of 1685 is
given in <i>l’Héroïne Chrétienne du Canada, ou Vie de Mlle. le Ber, Villemarie</i>, 1860. Charlevoix gives a map
with the old landmarks, and it is reproduced in Shea’s edition, ii. 170. A later one is in La Potherie, 1753
edition, ii. 311 (given above), and one of about 1759, in Miles’s <i>Canada</i>, p. 296.</p>
</div></div>

<p>He derives
new matter from the public archives in France,
goes over afresh the whole history of Champlain’s
career, and throws light on points left
dark by Charlevoix and the earlier narrators,
and is in some respects the best of the recent
French historians; but Parkman (<i>Jesuits</i>, p. 193)
cautions us that his partisan character as an
ardent and prejudiced Sulpitian should be well
kept in mind (cf. Field, p. 518; and chap. vii.
of the present volume). Dollier de Casson’s
<i>Histoire de Montréal</i>, 1640-1672, is a manuscript
in the Mazarin Library in Paris, of which Mr.
Parkman has a copy. It was printed in 1871 by
the Literary and Historical Society of Quebec,
in the third series of their historical documents.
Parkman refers to (<i>Jesuits</i>, p. 209), and gives
extracts from, <i>Les véritables Motifs ... de la
Société de Notre Dame de Montréal pour la Conversion
des Sauvages</i>, which was published in 1643
as a defence against aspersions of the “Hundred
Associates.” It was probably printed at Paris.
A copy some years since passed into an American
collection at 800 francs. A transcript of a
copy, collated by Margry, was used in the reprint
issued in the <i>Mémoires de la Société historique de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
Montreal</i>, in 1880, under the
editing of the Abbé Verreau,
who attributes it to Olier,
while Faillon has ascribed it
to Laisné de la Marguerie.
The editor adds some important
“notices bibliographiques
et documentaires;”
some “notes historiques par
le Commandeur Viger,” from
an unpublished work,&mdash;<i>Le
Petit Registre</i>; a “liste des
premiers Colons de Montreal.”
Of the older authorities,
Le Clercq and Charlevoix
(Shea’s edition, note, ii. 129)
are useful; but Charlevoix,
as Parkman says, was not
partial to Montreal. The
Société historique de Montreal
began in 1859 the publication
of <i>Mémoires et Documents
relatifs a l’histoire du
Canada</i>. The first number,
“Dè l’Esclavage en Canada,”
was the joint work of J. Viger
and L. H. Lafontaine, but it
has little matter falling within
the present period; the second,
“De la Famille des Lauson,”
the governor of New
France after 1651, by Lafontaine,
with an Appendix on
the “Vice-Rois et Lieutenants
Generaux des rois de
France en Amerique,” by R.
Bellemare; the third, “Ordonances
de M<sup>r</sup> Paul de
Chomedey, Sieur de Maisonneuve,
premier gouverneur de
Montreal,” etc; the fourth,
“Règne Militaire en Canada;”
the fifth, “Voyage de
Dollier et Galinée.” See a
paper on Montreal and its
founder, Maisonneuve, in the
<i>Canadian Antiquarian</i>, January,
1878. Concerning the connection of M.
Olier with the founding of Montreal and the
schemes connected with it for the conversion of
the savages, see Faillon, <i>Vie de M. Olier</i>, Paris,
1873, iii. 397, etc., and references there cited;

<p>The first martyr of the Huron mission was
Père Antoine Daniel, killed July 4, 1648 (Parkman’s

p. 146) says some curious, though perhaps
not very authentic, information regarding the
Hurons can be got from Sieur Gendron’s

le Sieur Gendron</i>, which appeared in Davity’s

country, is given herewith. Parkman also

<p class="p1">Masse died May 12, 1646, and this <i>Relation</i>
contains an account of him.</p>

<p>From October, 1645, to June, 1668, there are
journals of the Jesuit missionaries preserved in
the archives of the Séminaire at Quebec, which
give details not originally intended for the public
eye, but which now form an interesting supplement
to the series for the years 1645-1668,
except that there is a gap between Feb. 5, 1654
and Oct. 25, 1656. These journals were printed
at Quebec in 1871, as <i>Le Journal des Jésuites;
publié par les Abbés Laverdière et Casgrain</i>. Cf.
Carter-Brown, vol. ii. no. 1,009, where it is stated
that the greater part of the edition was destroyed
by fire. A continuation of this Journal was in
the hands of William Smith, historian of Canada;
but is now lost. The <i>Amer. Cath. Quarterly, U.
S. Cath. Mag.</i>, and <i>The Month</i> contain various
papers on the missions. See Poole’s <i>Index</i>.</p>

<p class="p1">After Jogues’ captivity among the Mohawks,
and his mutilations, and his rescue by the Dutch,
he wrote an account of <i>Novum Belgium</i> in 1643-1644,
which remained in manuscript till Dr. Shea
printed it with notes in 1862, as explained in a
note to chap. ix. of the present volume. Jogues
now went to France, but returned shortly to
brave once more the perils of a missionary’s
life, and this second venture he did not survive.
His own account of this was preserved, according
to Père Martin, in the archives of the College
of Quebec down to 1800, and according to
Dr. Shea passed into the hands of the English
Government, and was used by Smith in compiling
his <i>History of Canada</i>, Quebec, 1815, and has
not been seen since. “It is given apparently in
substance in the Relation of 1646.”&mdash;Shea’s
<i>Charlevoix</i>, ii. 188.</p>

<p>Dr. Shea also edited in English the “Jogues
Papers” in the <i>N. Y. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, 2d ser., vol.
iii., including the account of Jogues’ captivity
among the Mohawks; and he repeated the narrative
in his <i>Perils of the Ocean and Wilderness</i>, p. 16.
The original is a Latin letter, dated Rennselaerswyck,
Aug. 5, 1643, of which there is a sworn
copy preserved at Montreal, which differs somewhat
from the printed copy as given in Alegambe’s
<i>Mortes illustres</i>, Rome, 1667, p. 616 (Carayon,
no. 79); and in Tanner’s <i>Societas Jesu</i>,
Prague, 1675; and the German translation of it,
<i>Die Gesellschaft Jesu</i>, Prague, 1683. Cf. Carter-Brown,
vol. ii. nos. 1,136, 1,274; Field, <i>Indian
Bibliography</i>, 1,530; Stevens, <i>Bibliotheca Hist.</i>
2,017. The letter is badly translated in Bressani’s
<i>Breve Relatione</i>, p. 77, but Martin gives it
better in his version of Bressani (p. 188). Details,
more or less full, can be found in Andrada’s
<i>Claros Varones</i>, Madrid, 1666; Creuxius, <i>Historia
Canadensis</i>, pp. 338, 378; the Dutch <i>Church History</i>
of Hazart, vol. iv.; Barcia, <i>Ensayo Chronologico</i>,
Madrid, 1723, p. 205; Carayon, <i>Première
Mission</i>; the Bishop of Buffalo’s <i>Missions in
Western New York</i>, Buffalo, 1862; and of course
in Ferland, Parkman (<i>Jesuits</i>, pp. 106, 211, 217,
304), and the other modern historians. A portrait
of Jogues is given in Shea’s edition of the
<i>Novum Belgium</i>, and in his <i>Charlevoix</i>, ii. 141.</p>

<p class="p1">Father Gabriel Dreuillettes, in the interest
of the Abenakis mission, subsequently made a
journey in 1651 to Boston, to negotiate a league
between the New England colonies, the Canadian
authorities and the Abenakis against the
Iroquois. The papers appertaining were recovered
by Dr. Shea and printed in New York
in 1866, as <i>Recueil de Pièces sur la Négociation
entre la Nouvelle France et la Nouvelle Angleterre
ès années 1648 et suivantes</i>. A Latin letter from
Dreuillettes to Winthrop, which makes a part
of this book, had earlier been printed separately
in 1864 by Dr. Shea, and again in 1869. The
original manuscript was found among the Winthrop
Papers, and is now in the cabinet of the

<p>De Laval landed at Quebec June 6, 1659,
having been made Bishop of Petra and Vicar
Apostolic of New France the previous year.
He became Bishop of Quebec in 1674; resigned
in 1688, and died in 1708. Parkman draws a
distinct picture of his character in his <i>Old Régime</i>,
chap. v., and describes his appearance from several
portraits which are extant, one of which is
engraved in Shea’s <i>Le Clercq</i>, ii. p. 50. A Life
of him, by La Tour, was printed at Cologne in
1761; and an <i>Esquisse de la vie</i>, etc., at Quebec,
in 1845. Two other publications are of interest:
<i>Notice sur la fête à Quebec le 16 Juin, 1859,
200eme anniversaire de l’arrivée de Laval</i>, Quebec,
1859, and <i>Translation des Restes de Laval</i>, Quebec,
1878. Cf. Faillon, <i>Hist. de la Colonie Française</i>,
ii. chap. 13, and Shea’s <i>Charlevoix</i>, iii. 20, for references.
In 1874 the second centennial of Laval’s
becoming bishop was commemorated in a
<i>Notice biographique</i>, by E. Langevin, “suivie
de quarante-une lettres et notes historiques sur
le Chapitre de la Cathédrale,” published at
Montreal, 1874.</p>

<p>The Sisters of the Congregation of Notre
Dame were founded this year at Montreal, and
the life of the foundress, Margaret Bourgeois,
by Montgolfier, was published in Montreal in
1818; and was translated and published in
English in New York in 1880. Another Life,
said to be by the Abbé Faillon, was published
in 1853. An earlier Life, by Ransonet, was published
at Liege in 1728. Cf. Parkman’s <i>Jesuits</i>,
p. 201, and Shea’s <i>Charlevoix</i>, vol. v., for her
portrait.</p>

of the Sulpitians for the Bishopric, came over

ought to have it. Lenox says the map in this
edition is sometimes, but rarely, found with variations,
the position of some of the missions being
changed, and new stations added on the plate.</p>

change now taking place in the character of the
<i>Relations</i>, which are still “for the edification of
the pious reader, filled with intolerably tedious
stories of baptisms, conversions, and the exemplary
deportments of neophytes; but they are
relieved abundantly by more mundane
subjects,&mdash; ... observations on the
winds, currents, and tides of the Great

<p>A <i>Life of Madame de la Peltrie</i>
(Magdalen de Chauvigny), by Mother
St. Thomas, was published in New

<p>A companion of Madame de la
Peltrie was commemorated in <i>La Vie
de la Vénérable Mère Marie de l’Incarnation,
première Supérieure des Ursulines</i>
(Paris, 1677), by her son, Claude
Martin. She was in Canada from
1639 to 1672. (Harrisse, no. 143;
Lenox, pp. 13, 14; Dufossé, no. 6,763,
125 francs.) In 1681 a series of <i>Lettres
de la Vénérable Mère Marie de l’Incarnation</i>
was printed, and they cover
many historical incidents. (Harrisse,
no. 148; Dufossé, no. 3,166, 110
francs.) A selection of them was published
at Clermont Ferrand in 1837.
Charlevoix published a Life of her in
1724; and in 1864 one by Casgrain was
printed in Quebec, and in English at
Cork in 1880. In 1873 the French text
was included in <i>Œuvres de l’Abbé Casgrain</i>,
tome i. Another by the Abbé
Richardeau was printed at Tournai in
1873. There is a likeness of her in <i>Les Ursulines
de Québec depuis leur Etablissement jusqu’a
nos jours</i>. A. M. D. G. Quebec, 1863. 4 vols.
Shea (<i>Charlevoix</i>, i. 82; ii. 101; iii. 184) enumerates
other authorities: Juchereau, <i>Histoire de
l’Hôtel-Dieu de Québec</i>. Another History of the
Hôtel-Dieu, by Casgrain, was published in 1878.
An account of steps to procure her canonization
is in the <i>Catholic World</i> (New York), August,
1878. Cf. Parkman’s <i>Jesuits</i>, 174, 177, 199, 206.</p>

<p>As regards the date, 1717, for the beginning
of this series, Dr. Shea writes:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pi2 p1">“This date, though generally given, is, I am convinced,
erroneous. The first Recueil was approved
by the Provincial in 1702, and obtained the Royal
license to print Aug. 23, 1702. The approval of vol.
iii. is dated in 1703. It is clear that vol. i. must have
appeared in 1702 or 1703. I possess a translation of
vol. i. in English: ‘Edifying and Curious Letters of

Missions. Printed in the Year 1707. 16º.’ Of course
the French preceded this translation.”</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">FRONTENAC AND HIS TIMES.</p>

<p class="pc1">BY GEORGE STEWART, JR., F.R.S.C.</p>

<p class="drop-cap06">COURCELLE was succeeded as governor of New France by a man of
remarkable individuality, energy, and purpose. Louis de Buade,
Count of Palluau and Frontenac, is beyond any doubt the most conspicuous
figure which the annals of early colonization in Canada reveal. He
was the descendant of several generations of distinguished men who were
famous as courtiers and soldiers. He was of Basque origin, and the blood
of nobles flowed in his veins. His grandfather was Antoine de Buade, a
favorite of Henri IV., and one who performed the delicate mission, in 1600,
of carrying to Marie de Médicis the portrait of her royal lover. He stood
high in his sovereign’s estimation, was a counsellor of state and chevalier of
the noble order of the King, and the wearer of several other titles of dignity
and honor. By his wife, Jeanne Secontat, he had several children, among
whom was Henri de Buade, an officer of the court of Louis XIII., who succeeded
to the barony of Palluau, and became colonel of a Navarre regiment.
This Henri married, in 1613, Anne Phélippeaux, the daughter of
the Secretary of State. The future governor of New France, the fruit of
this union, was born in 1620. The King acted as godfather to the babe,
and bestowed on him his own name. When the child had attained his fifteenth
year he entered the army, and was sent to Holland to fight under the
Prince of Orange. Four years later he was conspicuous among the volunteers
at the stubborn siege of Hesdin; and at the age of twenty he displayed
great gallantry during a sortie of the garrison at Arras. In 1641 he
conducted himself with equal bravery at the siege of Aire, and one year
later, when he was only twenty-two years of age, he took part in the struggles
before Callioure and Perpignan. He was colonel of his regiment at
twenty-three, and during the sharp campaign in Italy commanded in several
hard-contested battles and sieges. Through all this martial career he
was often wounded, and at Orbitello had an arm fractured. He became
a maréchal de camp (brigadier-general) in 1646, and shortly after this the
first part of his military career came to a close, and he lived for a while in
his father’s house in Paris.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>In October, 1648, Frontenac espoused the young and beautiful Anne de
la Grange-Trianon, a maiden of imperious temper, lively wit, and marvellous
grace. She was one of the court beauties of the period, the intimate friend
and companion of Mademoiselle de Montpensier, grand-daughter of Henri
IV. Her portrait, painted as Minerva, now adorns one of the galleries at
Versailles. The marriage, which took place at the church of St. Pierre aux
Bœufs, in Paris, was contracted without the knowledge of the bride’s
parents. Some of Frontenac’s relatives witnessed the ceremony; but the
young Countess’s friends were greatly chagrined when they were informed
of the event, though their anger did not last long, and a reconciliation soon
followed. Not many months had elapsed before the painful discovery was
made that the young couple were unsuited to each other. The bride conceived
a positive dislike of her husband; and very soon after her son<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a>
was born she left his roof, and accepted Mademoiselle de Montpensier’s
friendly offer to join her suite. But the attachment between the two high-spirited
ladies did not continue long. They quarrelled, and the fair Countess
was dismissed from the court. The parting caused her some real
sorrow. Afterward, it is said, she intrigued to have her husband sent out
of the country. The Count had the ear of the King. He was a fine courtier,
polished in manner and chivalrous in spirit. He was reputed to be
one of the many lovers of the haughty beauty, Madame Montespan, the
favorite mistress of Louis XIV. He had, however, a most ungovernable
temper, and extravagance had left him a poor man. In 1669 Turenne, the
great soldier of Europe, selected him to conduct a campaign against the
Turks in Candia, where he displayed much of his wonted courage and
dash, but to small purpose, for the infidels triumphed in the end. The
prestige of Frontenac, however, remained untarnished, and his reputation
as a military leader increased. In 1672 the King further rewarded his
fidelity by appointing him Governor and Lieutenant-General of New France.
Various stories have been told as to the immediate cause of his appointment.
Several chronicles affirm that the King had detected his intimacy
with Madame de Montespan, and resolved at all hazards to get his dangerous
rival out of the way. Saint-Simon takes a different view of the situation,
and says that Frontenac “was a man of excellent parts, living much in
society, and completely ruined. He found it hard to bear the imperious
temper of his wife, and he was given the government of Canada to deliver
him from her, and afford him some means of living.” The Countess had no
mind to brave the rigors of her husband’s new seat of power, and accordingly
she accepted the offer of a suite of rooms at the Arsenal, where she
went to live with her congenial friend, the lively Mademoiselle d’Outrelaise.
During her long life at the Arsenal, she and her friend gave a tone to
French society; her <i>salon</i> became famous for its wit and gayety, and <i>les
Divines</i>, as the ladies were called, were sought after by the first people of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
the kingdom. Though she did not live with her husband, and held him in
some aversion, she never forgot that she was his wife. She corresponded
with him on occasion, and it is established that often she proved of signal
service to him in the furtherance of his ambitious plans and projects. It
was at the Arsenal she died, at the advanced age of seventy-five.</p>

<p>When Frontenac sailed for the colony he was a matured man of the
world, and fifty-two years of age. “Had nature disposed him to melancholy,”
says Parkman, “there was much in his position to awaken it. A
man of courts and camps, born and bred in the focus of a most gorgeous
civilization, he was banished to the ends of the earth, among savage hordes
and half-reclaimed forests, to exchange the splendors of St. Germain and
the dawning glories of Versailles for a stern gray rock, haunted by sombre
priests, rugged merchants and traders, blanketed Indians, and the wild bushrangers.
But Frontenac was a man of action. He wasted no time in vain
regrets, and set himself to his work with the elastic vigor of youth. His
first impressions had been very favorable. When, as he sailed up the St.
Lawrence, the basin of Quebec opened before him, his imagination kindled
with the grandeur of the scene. ‘I never,’ he wrote, ‘saw anything more
superb than the position of this town. It could not be better situated as
the future capital of a great empire.’” Such was the striking condition of
Quebec when Frontenac sailed into the port to assume the functions of his
office. The King, his powerful minister Colbert, the Intendant Talon, and
the Governor himself regarded the colony as a great prize, and one destined
for a future which should in no small degree reflect the glory and
grandeur of the old monarchy. Vast sums of money had been expended
in colonizing and defending it. Some of the best soldiers of the kingdom
and many desirable immigrants, inured to toil and hard work, were sent by
Louis to build up the new country and to develop its resources. Frontenac,
imbued with the same spirit as his sovereign, proceeded to bring his enormous
territory to a state of order. He convened a council at Quebec, and
administered an oath of allegiance to the leading men in his dominions.
He sought to inaugurate a monarchical form of government. He created,
with much pomp and show, three estates of his realm,&mdash;the clergy, nobles,
and commons. The former was composed of the Jesuits and the Seminary
priests. To three or four <i>gentilshommes</i> then living in Quebec he added
some officers belonging to his troops; and these comprised the order of
nobility. The commons consisted of the merchants and citizens. The
magistracy and members of council were formed into a distinct body,
though their place properly belonged to the third estate. This great convocation
took place on the 23d of October, 1672, and the ceremonies were
conducted in the church of the Jesuits, which had been decorated for the
purpose by the Fathers themselves.</p>

<p>Frontenac, who spoke and wrote well,
made a speech to the citizens, indicating the policy which he meant to pursue,
and scattering advice to the throng before him with a liberal hand.
The three estates which he had founded listened to an exhortation of some
length. The priests were urged to continue their labors in connection with
the conversion of the Indians, whom they were advised to train and civilize
while they converted. The nobles were praised for their culture and valiant
conduct, and urged to be assiduous in the improvement of the colony. To
the commons he recommended faithfulness in the discharge of their duties
to the King and to himself. After solemnly taking the oath, the assembly
dissolved. The Count next established municipal government in Quebec,
on a model which obtained in several cities of France. He ordered the
election of three citizens as aldermen, the senior of whom should rank as
mayor. This body was to take the place of the syndic, and it was provided
that one of the number should retire from office every year. The electors
would then fill the vacancy with some one of their choice, though the Governor
reserved the right to confirm or reject the successful candidate. He
then, with the assistance of some of the chief people about him, framed a
series of regulations for the government of the capital, and notified the inhabitants
that a meeting would be held twice a year, where public questions
would be discussed. Frontenac’s reforms were exceedingly distasteful to
the King, and the minister very clearly conveyed his Majesty’s views on the
subject, in a despatch written on the 13th of June, 1673. Talon, who knew
the temper of the Court in such matters, had wisely abstained from taking
an active part in the Governor’s scheme, and feigned illness as the cause for
his non-attendance at the convention. Colbert wrote: “The assembling
and division of all the inhabitants into three orders or estates, which you
have done, for the purpose of having them take the oath of fidelity, may
have been productive of good just then. But it is well for you to observe
that you are always to follow, in the government and management of that
country, the forms in force here; and as our kings have considered it for a
long time advantageous to their service not to assemble the States-General
of their kingdom, with a view perhaps to abolish insensibly that ancient
form, you likewise ought very rarely, or (to speak more correctly) never,
give that form to the corporate body of the inhabitants of that country;
and it will be necessary even in the course of a little time, and when the
colony will be still stronger than it now is, insensibly to suppress the syndic,
who presents petitions in the name of all the inhabitants, it being proper
that each should speak for himself, and that no one should speak for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
whole.” Louis’ policy was unmistakable. He assumed to be the autocrat
of his dominions, and anything which might be construed into an attempt
to weaken the principles of his policy met with a stern rebuke. Frontenac’s
colonial system might have benefited New France: it was capable of being
wisely administered, and rich developments might have ensued; but the
King would not have it, and the Governor was forced to withdraw his plan.</p>

<p>Arbitrary and domineering to a degree, always anxious to preserve his
dignity and to exact respect from his subordinates in office and from those
about his court, whether lay or clerical, and a martinet in compelling the
observance of all rules of social and military discipline, Frontenac, as may
be supposed, did not get on well with all parties in the colony. He made
the fatal mistake of quarrelling with the Jesuits and the Seminary priests,&mdash;the
two religious orders which at that time held the greater sway in Canada,
and whose influence among the people, and sometimes at court, was important,
and not easy to dispel. An enemy was also found in the Intendant
Talon, who suspiciously watched every movement which the Governor
made, and regularly reported his impressions to France. Talon, however,
was recalled before the quarrel had assumed very formidable proportions,
and Frontenac was well rid of him. A more dangerous element, and one
which could thwart him and upset his schemes, remained, however, to tantalize
him. He had his religious convictions, and was accounted a good-living
man, in the ordinary acceptance of the term. He regularly went to
Mass, and followed the observances of the Church; but his Catholicism was
framed in a more liberal school than that of the followers of Loyola. His
enemies said that he was a Jansenist. He leaned towards the Recollect
Fathers, attended their place of worship, and often called on the King for
additional priests of that order, and took every opportunity to show them
attention and marks of his favor. When the Jesuits appeared too strong
in number, he sent to France for more Recollects, and through them he
neutralized to some extent the influence of the former. But the Jesuits
were powerful, diplomatic, and insidious. They constantly watched their
opportunity, and changed their mode of warfare according to the circumstances
of the hour. When the gloved hand answered their purpose, they
used it; but they had no scruple to strike with stronger weapons. Had
Frontenac chosen at the outset of his career to conciliate them and to play
into their hands, his administration might have been less fretful to himself
and vexatious to others. He might have fulfilled his original intention, and
bettered his fortunes in the way he desired. He might have carried out some
of his cherished reforms, for his zeal in that direction was really very great,
and he had his heart in his task; but his haughty disposition would not be
curbed, and he preferred to be aggressive towards the Jesuits rather than
conciliatory. The result may be foreseen. Enemies sprang up about him
on every side, and often they were more dangerous than the Iroquois tribes
who constantly menaced the colony, and far more difficult to check than the
English of Massachusetts or of Albany. He early began writing letters to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
the minister about his trials with the clergy. On the 2d of November, 1672,
he wrote: “Another thing displeases me, and this is the complete dependence
of the Grand Vicar and the Seminary priests on the Jesuits, for they
never do the least thing without their order; so that they [the Jesuits] are
masters in spiritual matters, which, as you know, is a powerful lever for
moving everything else.” He complained of their spies, and proceeded to
resist their influence wherever he found it asserting itself. The Sulpitians
fared no better at his hands, and he waged as bitter a warfare against them
and those who followed their teachings. He befriended the Recollects so
warmly, that it is not strange that they eagerly lent him all the assistance
they could to further his efforts in breaking down the power of their rivals.
It is said that at first he favored them out of a mere spirit of opposition to
the Bishop and his allies, the Jesuits; but as time wore on, his favor deepened
into affection, and he more than once declared to the King that the Recollects
ought to be more numerous than they were. He told Colbert that their
superior was a “very great preacher,” and that he had “cast into the shade
and given some chagrin to those in this country who certainly are not so
able.” He charged the clergy with abusing the confessional and intermeddling
with private family affairs, and expressed his dislike in strong terms
of their secret doings in the colony, and their attempts to set husbands
against wives, and parents against children,&mdash;“and all,” he wrote to the
minister, “as they say, for the greater glory of God.” It is clear that the
Count distrusted the “Black Gowns” from the very first, and resolved to
hold them at arm’s length. Much of his energy was wasted in trying to
lessen their influence at court; and the King and his minister were kept
pretty busy reading and answering the recriminatory letters of the Governor
and his unsympathetic intendants, whose feelings always prompted them to
side with the Jesuits and the Church, and against Frontenac.</p>

</div>

<p>A policy of Louis XIV. was the civilization of the Indians, and Frontenac
was, early in his career, instructed to take means to civilize them, to
have them taught the French language, and to
amalgamate them with the colonists. At that
time the Count knew very little about Indian nature;
but he embarked in the scheme with all
his energy and zeal. He soon gained a mastery over the most savage
tribes, taught the warriors to call him father, and succeeded in inducing the
Iroquois to intrust him with the care of eight of their children,&mdash;four girls
and four boys. The former were given to the Ursulines, while he kept two
of the boys in his own house, and placed the others, at his own cost, in
respectable French families, and had them sent to school to be educated.
He tried to get the Jesuits to assist him in this task, but they failed to
respond cordially to his urging; and he complained bitterly of their want
of sympathy with the movement, even charging them&mdash;not very accurately,
it must be admitted&mdash;with “refusing to civilize the Indians, because they
wished to keep them in perpetual wardship.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>But a new question now arose, and Frontenac’s mind was turned towards
western exploration. He warmly favored the idea, and, relinquishing for
the moment all thought of his trials with the priests, he gave his whole
attention to the proposals of that bold and self-reliant explorer, the Sieur
Robert de la Salle. This young man was poor in pocket, but his head was
full of schemes. There was much in common between the two men. Both
had strong will and ability of no mean calibre. They were not easily discouraged,
and having once engaged in an undertaking, they had sufficient
determination to carry it through. Frontenac greatly liked La Salle, and
the two remained fast friends for many years. A short time before the Governor
arrived in Canada, the Iroquois had made an attack on the French,
and Courcelle had been compelled to punish them. To keep them in
check and to facilitate the fur-trade of the upper country, he decided that
a fort should be built near the outlet of Lake Ontario. This determination
had also been reached some time before by the Intendant Talon, and
both officers had submitted the suggestion to the King. Frontenac was
not long in perceiving the advantages which the establishment of such a
fort presented, and he resolved to build it, as much to protect the colony as
to augment his own slender resources, which were running very low. La
Salle had gained the confidence of the Governor, who had listened to his
overtures, and manifested great interest in everything he said. “There was
between them,” says Parkman, “the sympathetic attraction of two bold and
energetic spirits; and though Cavelier de la Salle had neither the irritable
vanity of the Count nor his Gallic vivacity of passion, he had in full measure
the same unconquerable pride and hardy resolution. There were but
two or three others in Canada who knew the western wilderness so well.
He was full of schemes of ambition and of gain; and from this moment he
and Frontenac seem to have formed an alliance which ended only with the
Governor’s recall.” The fort recommended by Courcelle, if built, might be
employed in intercepting the trade which the tribes of the upper lakes had
begun to carry on with the Dutch and English of New York. This trade
Frontenac resolved to secure for Canada, though it must be said that those
who would have control of the fort would monopolize the larger share of
the traffic to themselves, to the great displeasure of the other merchants, who
resolutely set their faces against the project. Frontenac knew this perfectly
well, for it was principally with a desire to benefit himself that he had given
the plan countenance. La Salle understood the western country, and was
familiar with Lake Ontario and its shores. He soon convinced the Governor
that the most suitable spot for the contemplated fortified post was at the
mouth of the River Cataraqui, and there, where the city of Kingston now
stands, the fort<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> was built, in July, 1673. La Salle had told Frontenac that
the English were intriguing with the Iroquois and the tribes of the upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
lakes to get them to break the treaty with the French and bring their furs to
New York. This statement was true, and it hastened the Governor’s action.
With his usual address, he announced his intention of making a tour
through the upper parts of the colony with a strong force of men, that the
Iroquois and their associates might be intimidated, and with a view to the
securing of a more permanent peace. He had no money to carry on this
crusade, so he issued an order to the people of Quebec, Montreal, and
Three Rivers, and other settlements within his jurisdiction, calling on them
to supply him, at their own cost, with men and canoes as soon as the spring
sowing had passed. The officers in the colony were requested to join the
expedition, and they dared not refuse. On the 3d of June Frontenac left
Quebec, accompanied by his guard, his staff, some of the garrison of the
Castle of St. Louis, and a band of volunteers. Arriving at Montreal, he
tarried there thirteen days with his following. There were some matters
which required his attention, and he speedily set about to arrange them in
a manner which should at least be satisfactory to himself.</p>

<p>La Salle had been despatched to Onondaga, the political stronghold of
the Iroquois, on a mission to secure the attendance of their chiefs at a
council convened by the Governor, to be held at the Bay of Quinté, situated
on the north of Lake Ontario. While the intrepid traveller was on his way,
Frontenac changed his mind about the place of rendezvous, and sent a messenger
after him, calling the sachems to meet at Cataraqui, where he decided
to construct the fort. The Governor of Montreal received Frontenac with
suitable honors. He met him on shore with his soldiers and people, a
salute was fired, and the judge and the syndic pronounced speeches of interminable
length, but loyal and patriotic in sentiment. The priests of St.
Sulpice received him at their church, where an address of welcome was
presented. The <i>Te Deum</i> was sung, and the Count then retired into the
fort, and began preparing for his coming journey. It was not long before
he discovered that his project found little favor in the eyes of the people of
Montreal, who feared that much of their trade might be diverted from them
by the construction of the new post. The Jesuits, too, were opposed to the
rearing of forts and trading posts in the upper districts, and they did what
they could to discourage the scheme. Frontenac was warned that a Dutch
fleet had captured Boston, and would soon proceed to attack Quebec. Dablon
was the author of this last rumor; but the Count turned a deaf ear to
remonstrance and report, and continued his preparations. His followers
and their stores were already on the way to Lachine, and on the twenty-eighth
of June the Governor-General himself set out. His force consisted
of four hundred men, including the Mission Indians, and one hundred and
twenty canoes and two flat-bottomed boats. The voyage was an arduous
and difficult one. Without the Indians, it is a question whether it could
have been accomplished at all. The fearful journey was full of perils and
hardships, and, to add to their discomfiture, before the place of destination
was reached rain fell in torrents. Frontenac’s management of the Indians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
approached the marvellous. They worked for him with genuine zeal, and
showed by their toil as much as by their manner that they respected his
authority and admired him as a man. He divined the Indian nature well,
though he had been in the country but a few months; and the longer he
remained in the colony, the greater his influence over them became. He
knew when to bully and when to conciliate, when to apply blandishments
and when to be stern. It was a happy thought which prompted him to call
himself their father. It gave him the superiority of position at once.
Other Onontios were brothers; but the great Onontio was the father.<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a> He
really liked the Indians, and could enter into their ways and customs with a
spirit born of good-will. He was a frank, and often fiery soldier, and a true
courtier; but he could be playful with the Indian children, and it was not
beneath his dignity to lead a war-dance, should policy demand, as it did
sometimes. He seemed to know the thoughts of his dusky friends, and
they felt that he could read what was passing through their minds. His
control over the tribes, friends and foes alike, was certainly never surpassed
by any white man.</p>

</div>

<p>He was, moreover, true to his allies; and on more than one occasion refused
to make peace for himself with the ferocious Iroquois, when he could
easily have done so, unless they complied with his terms, and included in
the treaty the Indians
friendly to the
French. He would
never abandon his
friends to save himself; and the tribes, hostile and friendly,
early in his career learned this, and it served to establish his
fame as a man of fair dealing and chivalrous principle. He never
yielded his point even when his savage enemies were many and his own
forces few and feeble. He maintained his ascendency always, and lecturing
his children, pointed out the duties they should observe. Such was his personal
magnetism, that they listened and obeyed him when their following was
five times as great as his own. The secret of Frontenac’s supremacy over
savage nature seemed to lie in the fact that he never ceased to have perfect
faith and belief in himself. He had fiery blood in his veins, and an iron will,
that the blandishments which he employed at times never quite concealed.
Even when reduced to severe straits, he did not lose that boldness of demeanor
which carried him through so many perils. The Iroquois gave him
most trouble. They were fond of fighting, and when they were not attacking
the French, they were waging war on the Illinois and Hurons, and on
other tribes whose aid was often found on the side of Frontenac. The Confederacy
preferred to sell their peltries to the English and Dutch of Albany,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
than to the French. They drove with the English better bargains and
secured higher prices, and the English encouraged them to bring to them
their beaver skins. But the tribes who were friendly to their white enemies
had by far the richest product of these furs, and La Salle’s fort of St. Louis,
the mission of Michillimackinac, and other posts really controlled the trade.
To gain this traffic, and to divert it into the hands of their newly-found
friends, the English and Dutch, the five tribes of the League proceeded in
1673 to make war on the Indians who engrossed it. Great anxiety was felt
in the colony when this determination on the part of the Confederacy became
known, and the tribes interested&mdash;the Illinois, the Hurons, and Ottawas&mdash;manifested
the utmost fear. Frontenac deemed a conference advisable, and
he invited the Iroquois to come to him and discuss affairs; but the arrogant
warriors sent back an insolent answer, and told the messenger that Frontenac
should come to them,&mdash;a suggestion which some of the French, who were
terror-stricken, urged the Governor to act upon. But the Count had no such
intention, and refused to make any concession. He sent them word that he
would go no farther than Montreal, or, at the utmost, to Fort Frontenac, to
meet them. In August, he met the Hurons and Ottawas at Montreal in
council. There had been jealousy among the tribes, but the Count warned
them against dissension among themselves, called them his children, and
exhorted them to live together as brethren. A celebrated Iroquois chief
came next, with several of his followers. This was Decanisora, who invited
Frontenac to Oswego to meet the Five Tribes. The Count, determined to
hold his ground, replied with firmness, “It is for the father to tell the children
where to hold council, not for the children to tell the father. Fort
Frontenac is the proper place, and you should thank me for going so far
every summer to meet you.” He then conciliated the chief with presents
and a wampum belt, telling him that the Illinois were Onontio’s children,
and therefore his brethren, and that he wished them all to live together in
harmony. There was peace for a brief space, but it did not continue many
months.</p>

<p>When Frontenac neared the end of his toilsome journey, and had reached
the first opening of Lake Ontario, he made up his mind to show the Iroquois
the full extent of his power, and to make as imposing a display as
possible. He arranged his canoes in line of battle, and disposed of them in
this wise: four squadrons, composing the vanguard, went in front and in
one line; then the two bateaux followed, and after them came the Count
at the head of all the canoes of his guard, of his staff, and of the volunteers
attached to his person. On his right, the division from Three Rivers, and
on his left, the Hurons and Algonquins were placed. Two other squadrons
formed a third line, and composed the rear-guard. In this order they proceeded
about half a league, when an Iroquois canoe was observed to be
approaching. It contained the Abbé d’Urfé (who had met the Indians
above the River Cataraqui, and notified them of the Count’s arrival) and
several Iroquois chiefs, who offered to guide their visitors to the place of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
rendezvous. After an exchange of civilities, their offer was accepted, and
the whole party proceeded to the spot selected. The Count was greatly
pleased with the locality, and spent the rest of the afternoon of the 12th of
July in examining the ground. The Iroquois were impatient to have him
visit them that night in their tents; but he sent them word that it was now
too late, but that in the morning, when it would be more convenient to see
and entertain each other, he would gladly do so. This reply was considered
satisfactory. At daybreak the next morning, the <i>réveillé</i> was sounded, and
at seven o’clock everybody was astir and under arms. The troops were drawn
up in double file around Frontenac’s tent, and extended to the cabins of the
Indians. Large sails were placed in front of his tent for the savage deputies
to sit on, and to the number of sixty they passed through the two files thus
formed to the council. They were greatly impressed with the display, and
“after having sat, as is their custom, and smoked some time,” says the journal
of the Count’s voyage, “one of them, named Garakontie, who had
always been the warmest friend of the French, and who ordinarily acted
as spokesman, paid his compliment in the name of all the nations, and
expressed the joy they felt on learning from Sieur de la Salle Onontio’s
design to come and visit them. Though some evil-disposed spirits had
endeavored to excite jealousy among them at his approach, they could not,
they said, hesitate to obey his orders, but would come and meet him in the
confidence that he wished to treat them as a father would his children.
They were then coming, they continued, as true children, to assure him
of their obedience, and to declare to him the entire submission they should
always manifest to his command. The orator spoke, as he claimed, in the
name of the Five Nations, as they had only one mind and one thought, in
testimony whereof the captain of each tribe intended to confirm what he
had just stated in the name of the whole.” The other chiefs followed, and
after complimenting Frontenac, each captain presented a belt of wampum,
“which is worthy of note,” says the chronicle, “because formerly it was
customary to present only some fathoms of stringed wampum.”</p>

<p>The Count replied in a form of address very similar to theirs. He assured
them that they did right in obeying the command of their father, told
them to take courage, and not to think that he had come to make war. His
mind was full of peace, and peace walked by his side. After this harangue,
he ordered six fathoms of wampum to be given to them, and a gift of guns
for the men, and prunes and raisins for the women and children. The great
council took place later on. Meanwhile, the construction of the fort began,
and the workmen pursued their task with such ardor and speed, that by the
17th of July, the date fixed for the grand council, it was well advanced.
The work was done under the supervision of Raudin, the engineer of the
expedition. The Indians watched the building of the fort with curious interest.
The Count regularly entertained two or three of the principal Iroquois
at each meal, while he fondled the children and distributed sweetmeats
among them, and invited the squaws to dance in the evenings. The great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
council assembled at eight o’clock in the morning. The ceremony was the
same as that which had been observed at the preliminary meeting. Frontenac
wore his grandest air. He entreated them to become Christians, and
to listen to the instructions of the “Black Gowns.” He praised, scolded,
and threatened them in turn, and drawing their attention to his retinue,
said: “If your father can come so far, with so great a force, through such
dangerous rapids, merely to make you a visit of pleasure and friendship,
what would he do if you should awaken his anger, and make it necessary
for him to punish his disobedient children? He is the arbiter of peace and
war. Beware how you offend him.” He further warned them not to molest
the allies of the French, on pain of chastisement. He told them that the
storehouse at Cataraqui was built as a proof of his affection, and that all
the goods they needed could be had from there. He could not give them
the terms yet, because the cost of transportation was so far unknown to him.
He cautioned them against listening to men of bad character, and recommended
the Sieur de la Salle and such as he as persons to be heeded.
He asked the chiefs to give him a number of their children to be educated
at Quebec, not as hostages, but out of pure friendship. The Indians wanted
time to consider this proposition, and the next year they acceded to it. At
intervals, during the delivery of his speech, Frontenac paused and gave the
Indians presents, which seemed to please them. The council closed, and
three days later, the Iroquois started on their journey homeward, while
Frontenac’s party returned in detachments. The fort was finished, and the
barracks nearly built. Frontenac would have left with his men for home
sooner than he did, but a band of Indians from the villages on the north
side of Lake Ontario being announced, he remained with some troops to receive
them. He treated them as he had treated the others, and pronounced
the same speech. Leaving a garrison in the fort, he then set out for Montreal,
which he reached on the 1st of August.<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a></p>

<p>The enterprise cost the King ten thousand francs, and Frontenac regarded
the investment as a good one indeed. He hoped that he had impressed the
savages with fear and respect, that he had obtained a respite from the ravages
of the Iroquois, and that the fort would be the means of keeping the
peltry trade in the hands of the French, its situation affording the opportunity
of cutting it off from the English, who were making efforts to secure it
for themselves. Frontenac wrote to the minister in November, that with a
fort at the mouth of the Niagara and a vessel on Lake Erie, the French
could command all the upper lakes.</p>

<p>François Perrot, the Governor of Montreal, owed his position to Talon,
his wife’s uncle, who had induced the Sulpitians, the proprietors and feudal
lords of Montreal and the island, and in whom the appointment rested, to
give the place to him. Knowing that the priests could at will depose him,
he sought to protect himself by asking the King to give him a royal appointment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
This Louis did; and the Sulpitians could now make no change
without consent of the King. Perrot was a man of little principle, selfish
and unscrupulous, who turned every movement to his own advantage.
His passion was for money-making, and his position as governor gave him
many opportunities. One of his first acts, with that object in view, was
to set up a storehouse on Perrot Island, which gave him full command of
the fur-trade. This post was situated just above Montreal, and directly in
the route of the tribes of the upper lakes and their vicinity. A retired
and trusted lieutenant, named Brucy, was placed in charge, whose chief
business it was to intercept the Indians and secure their merchandise, to
the no small profit of the Governor and himself, and the great scandal of
the neighborhood. The forests were ranged by <i>coureurs de bois</i>, who also
trafficked with the savages, and bore off the richest peltries before the
real merchants of Montreal had had the opportunity. King Louis had in
vain attempted, by royal edicts of outlawry and stringent instructions to
his representatives and subordinates, to dislodge the bushrangers and to put
an end to their doings. The <i>coureurs de bois</i>, however, were hardy sons of
the soil; some of them were soldiers who had deserted from the army; all
of them were men of endurance, and accustomed to brave the sternest hardships.
They loved their wild life and the adventurous character of their
calling. They were, moreover, on very excellent terms with Perrot, who
connived at their escapades and shut his ears to all complaint. He had no
motive to heed the order of his sovereign, so long as the wayward rangers
shared with him the proceeds of their dealings with the Indians. This, on
their part, they were very willing to do.</p>

<p>Frontenac was jealous of Perrot’s advantages, and though he had but
few soldiers in his command with whom to enforce obedience, he determined
to strike a blow at the bushrangers, and make an attempt to execute
the King’s orders. Perrot had of late grown despotic and tyrannical. He
was comparatively beyond the reach of his superior, and had matters pretty
much under his own control. The journey from Quebec to Montreal sometimes
occupied a fortnight, and the Governor-General, as he well knew, was
not able to strike heavily with the shattered remnants of forces who served
under him. Perrot was therefore bold and defiant; but he miscalculated
the temper of his chief, and it was not long before the arms of Frontenac
were long enough to reach him. Perrot, in a fit of temper, had imprisoned
the judge of Montreal because that functionary had dared to
remonstrate against the disorders which had been perpetrated by the
<i>coureurs de bois</i>. The affair caused much excitement; and with other
acts of the Governor, the Sulpitians were soon convinced of the grave
error they had made in their choice of a chief magistrate. They were
powerless, however, to unseat him. Frontenac now wrote to the minister,
and asked for a galley, to the benches of which it was his intention to chain
the outlaws as rowers. He then ordered the judge at Montreal to seize
every <i>coureur de bois</i> that he could find. Two of them were living at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
house of Lieutenant Carion, a friend of Perrot’s, and when the judge’s constable
went to lay hands on them, Carion abused the officer, and allowed
the men to escape. Perrot indorsed the conduct of his lieutenant, and even
threatened the judge
with arrest, should he
make a similar attempt
again.</p>

        <p class="pf250">A fac-simile of a print in Potherie, vol. i.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Frontenac,
when he heard of
the manner in which
his orders had been
treated, flew into a
passion. He despatched
Lieutenant
Bizard and three soldiers
to Montreal,
charged to arrest and
convey to the capital
the offending Carion.
Bizard succeeded in
making the arrest, and
left a letter in the
house of Le Ber the
merchant for Perrot,
from Frontenac, giving
notice of what had
been done. Perrot
was, however, earlier
advised of the arrest.
He hastened with a
sergeant and three or
four soldiers, found
Bizard, and indignantly
ordered him under
arrest. Nor did Le
Ber fare better, for,
because he had testified
to the scene he
had witnessed, he was
thrown into jail. These arrests produced much excitement in the place, and
Perrot after a while was aware that he had acted with inconsiderate rashness.
He released Bizard, and sent him off to Quebec, the bearer of a sullen and
impertinent letter to the Count. In due time an answer came, in an order
to come to Quebec and render an account of his conduct. Frontenac also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
wrote to the Abbé Salignac de Fénelon,<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a>&mdash;a zealous young missionary stationed
at Montreal, one of whose uncles had been a firm friend of Frontenac
during the progress of the Canadian war,&mdash;and desired him to see Perrot and
explain the situation. The Abbé’s task was a delicate but congenial one,
and he pursued it with such good effect that the Governor was induced to
accompany him to headquarters. They made the journey on snow-shoes, and
walked the whole distance of one hundred and eighty miles on the St. Lawrence.
The interview with the Count was short. Both men were choleric
and easily excited. Perrot was disappointed at his reception, after taking
the trouble to come so far, and at such a season of the year. Frontenac
was stubborn and angry, and the position of his rival at his feet did not
mollify his passion, but rather increased it. He put an end to the interview
by locking up his offending subordinate in the château, and ordering guards
to be placed over him day and night. A trusty friend of Frontenac, La
Nouguère by name, was despatched to Montreal to take command. Brucy
was seized and cast into prison, while a determined war was made on the
<i>coureurs de bois</i>. The two who had been the main cause of the recent
trouble were captured and sent to Quebec, where one of them was hanged
in the presence of Perrot. The end of this war of extermination soon
came, and Frontenac informed the minister that only five of these rangers
of the wood remained at large; all the others had returned to the settlements,
and given up their hazardous calling.</p>

<p>The old jealousy between Quebec and Montreal now showed itself again.
The Sulpitians thought that Frontenac had acted a high-handed part in
placing La Nouguère in command over their district without as much as
consulting them. Perrot was still their selected governor, and they revolted
against the arbitrary conduct of the Governor-General. They roused the
colonists against Frontenac’s course, and the Abbé Fénelon, who possessed
many of the indiscretions of youth, and who felt that he had been trapped,
became the most bitter of the Count’s enemies. Before he left Quebec to
return home, he gave his former friend a good deal of abuse; and his first
act on reaching Montreal was to preach a sermon full of meaning against
Frontenac. Dollier de Casson, the superior of the congregation, reproved
the preacher and disclaimed the sermon. Fénelon, in turn, declared that
bad rulers in general, and not Frontenac in particular, were meant; but his
future conduct belied his words. He made the cause of Perrot his own,
and was active in his behalf. Frontenac summoned him before the council
on a charge of inciting sedition. The Abbé d’Urfé, a relative of Fénelon,
tried to smooth matters over with the Count, but he fared very ill, and was
shown the door for his pains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>And now ensued a remarkable trial before the council at Quebec. Perrot
was charged with disobeying the royal edicts and of treating with contempt
the royal authority. The other offender was the Abbé Fénelon.
Frontenac had a pliant council to second his wishes. The councillors
owed their positions to him, and as he had power to remove them when he
willed, they soon ranged themselves on his side, and showed that they were
friendly to his cause. Perrot challenged the right of the Governor-General
to preside over the case, on the ground that he was a personal enemy.
He moreover objected to several of the councillors on various pretexts.
New judges were appointed for the trial, and Perrot’s protests continuing,
the board overruled all his exceptions, and the trial went on. Other sessions
proceeded to try the impetuous Abbé. Frontenac presided at the
council-board. When Fénelon was led in, he seated himself in a vacant
chair, though ordered to stand by the Count, and persisted in wearing his
hat firmly pressed over his brows. Hot words passed between the Governor
and his prisoner, the result of which was that the Abbé was put under
arrest. The priest assumed that Frontenac had no right to try him, and
that the ecclesiastical court alone had jurisdiction over him. The war grew
fierce, and the councillors, half afraid of what they had done, at length
decided to refer the question to the King himself. The Governor of Montreal
and the vehement Abbé were accordingly despatched to France, and
all the documents relating to the case were sent with them. Frontenac
presented his side of the argument in a long despatch, which, considering
his provocation, was moderate in tone and calm in judgment. The Abbé
d’Urfé accompanied the prisoners to France, and as his cousin, the Marquise
d’Allègre, was shortly to marry Seignelay, the son of Colbert, he
hoped much from his visit. Perrot, too, was not without friends near the
King: Talon, his wife’s relative, held a post at court. Besides these influences
the Church had other means at work.</p>

<p>In April, 1675, the King and Colbert disposed of the Perrot question.
They wrote calmly and with dignity. His Majesty condemned the action
of Perrot in imprisoning Bizard, and had the offender confined for three
weeks in the Bastile, “that he may learn to be more circumspect in the discharge
of his duty, and that his example may serve as a warning to others.”
He had already endured ten months of imprisonment in Quebec. The
King also told Frontenac that he should not, “without absolute necessity,”
cause his “commands to be executed within the limits of a local government,
like that of Montreal, without first informing its governor.” Perrot
was sent back to his government, and ordered to apologize to Frontenac.
Colbert informed the Count of the approaching marriage of his son with the
heiress of the house of Allègre, and hinted at the closeness of the connection
which existed between the Abbé d’Urfé and himself. Frontenac was
urged to show the Abbé “especial consideration,” and also to treat with
kindness the priests of Montreal. Fénelon was sustained in his plea that
he had the right to be tried by an ecclesiastical tribunal; but his superior,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
Bretonvilliers, absolutely forbade him to return to Canada, and wrote a
letter to the members of his order at Montreal, telling them not to interfere
in worldly matters, but to profit by the example of M. Fénelon. He
advised them “in matters of this sort” to “stand neutral.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-334.jpg" width="400" height="67" id="i334"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>The King now resolved to make some administrative changes in New
France, with a view, it is probable, of lessening the hold of Frontenac on
the body politic of the colony. He announced that the appointment of
councillors should rest with him alone in future, and promptly filled the
vacant office of Intendant by appointing M. Duchesneau whose duty it was
to watch the Governor-General, and to manage certain details in executive
work. Bishop Laval, who had been absent from Canada for some time,
also returned to his see; and Frontenac, who had ruled alone, without
bishop, without intendant, and with a subservient council, viewed the new
aspect of affairs with ill-concealed disgust. It was not long before the
threatened outbreak came. The question of selling brandy to the natives,
which had disturbed previous administrations, became again a contention
between governor and prelate.<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> The Intendant promptly sided with the
Bishop and the clergy, while the latter stood aside at times, and allowed
their secular ally to lead the contest, content themselves to give him arguments
and advice. One question after another arose. Many of them were
of trivial import, but all of them were vexatious and troublesome, and to an
imperious mind like Frontenac’s galling in the extreme. The old rivalry
of Church and State in the matter of honors and precedence became
troublesome. Colbert wrote strongly to Duchesneau, and ordered him not
to make himself a partisan of the Bishop, and to pay proper respect to
Frontenac. The latter was commanded to live in harmony and peace with
the Intendant. The King was incensed at the constant bickerings, and
ordered Frontenac to conform to the practice prevailing at Amiens, and to
demand no more. The Intendant was roundly berated by the minister, who
told him that he ought to be able to understand the difference between a
governor and an intendant, and that he was completely in the wrong as
regards the pretensions he had assumed.</p>

<p>But if the religious quarrel was settled for a time, a civil difficulty arose.
The council no longer remained a mere body for registering the Governor’s
decrees. The new order of things gave him a council of men who were
opposed in many respects to his views and interests. The King had reinstated
Villeray,&mdash;a former councillor, and a man wholly under Jesuitical
influence. Frontenac, who thought him a “Jesuit in disguise,” called him
“an intriguing busybody, who makes trouble everywhere.” The attorney-general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
was Auteuil, another enemy of the Governor. Tilly was a third
member, and the Count at first approved of him; but his opinion was
destined to change. Under the ordinance of Sept. 23, 1675, the Intendant,
whose official position entitled him to rank as the third man in the colony,
was appointed president of the council. His commission, dated June 5,
1675, read: “Présider au Conseil Souverain en l’absence du dit Sieur de
Frontenac.” Frontenac was styled in many of the despatches which reached
him from the Crown, “Chief and President of the Council.” A conflict of
authority immediately arose, and both Governor and Intendant claimed with
equal right (one would suppose from the royal documents in their possession)
the position of presiding officer. Frontenac bided his time, and
remained patient until late in the autumn, when the last vessel cleared for
France. Then he asserted his claim to the title of chief and president, and
demanded to be so styled on the records of the council. In support of his
contention he exhibited a letter from Louis dated May 12, 1678. The
Intendant, supported by the clergy, opposed the claim. The Governor refused
to compromise, scolded Duchesneau, and threatened to teach him his
duty, while he ordered Villeray, Tilly, and Auteuil to their houses, and
commanded them to remain there until he should give them permission to
leave.<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> Auteuil begged the King to interfere, and the wearied monarch
wrote to his representative: “You have wished to be styled Chief and President
on the records of the supreme council, which is contrary to my edict
concerning that council; and I am the more surprised at this demand, since
I am very sure that you are the only man in my kingdom who, being honored
with the title of governor and lieutenant-general, would care to be
styled chief and president of such a council as that of Quebec.” So the
King refused the title of president to either, and commanded that Duchesneau
should perform the duties of presiding officer. He also said that
Frontenac had abused his authority in exiling two councillors and the
attorney-general for so trivial a cause, and warned him to be careful in
future, lest he be recalled from office. Several other disputes in the council
followed. They were mostly about matters of small moment, but they
created great storms while they lasted. The imprisonment of Councillor
Amours by order of the Count for an alleged infringement of the passport
law, and the presence of his wife with a petition to the council for redress
and a speedy trial, caused much discussion and provoked very strong
feeling.</p>

<p>Duchesneau was the object of Frontenac’s constant displeasure. On
him was visited his fiercest wrath; but the Intendant bore it all with varying
moods,&mdash;sometimes disputing with Frontenac, at others abusing him, and
occasionally treating the diatribe of vituperation which flowed from the
Count’s lips with lofty disdain and scorn. He wrote letters to the Court, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
lodged complaint after complaint against the Governor, who, in his turn, pursued
the same course. Out of the council quarrels others involving more
important issues sprang up, and nearly all the people in the colony were in
time driven to one side or the other. With Frontenac, as Parkman points
out, were ranged La Salle and his lieutenant, La Forêt; Du Lhut, the
leader of the <i>coureurs de bois</i>; Boisseau, agent of the farmers of the revenue;
Barrois, the Governor’s secretary; Bizard, lieutenant of his guard;
and others. Against him were the members of the council, Aubert de la
Chesnaye, Le Moyne and his sons, Louis Joliet, Jacques Le Ber, Sorel,
Boucher, Varennes, and many of the ecclesiastics. Duchesneau received
replies from the Court, and they must have been galling to his pride and
self-respect. He was plainly assured that though Frontenac was not blameless,
his own conduct was far more open to censure. In this strain Colbert’s
letter continued, and he said: “As to what you say concerning his violence,
his trade with the Indians,<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> and in general all that you allege against him,
the King has written to him his intentions; but since, in the midst of all
your complaints, you say many things which are without foundation, or
which are no concern of yours, it is difficult to believe that you act in the
spirit which the service of the King demands,&mdash;that is to say, without
interest and without passion. If a change does not appear in your conduct
before next year, his Majesty will not keep you in your office.” The
King returned his usual advice to Frontenac, told him to live on good terms
with the Intendant, and prohibited him from trading with the Indians. But
neither the letters of the King nor the minister had much effect apparently,
for the Governor and Intendant continued to war against each other.
At last the King wrote thus sharply to the Count:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“What has passed in regard to the <i>coureurs de bois</i> is entirely contrary to my
orders, and I cannot receive in excuse for it your allegation that it is the Intendant
who countenances them by the trade he carries on, for I perceive clearly that the fault
is your own. As I see that you often turn the orders I give you against the very object
for which they are given, beware not to do so on this occasion. I shall hold you
answerable for bringing the disorder of the <i>coureurs de bois</i> to an end throughout
Canada; and this you will easily succeed in doing if you make a proper use of my
authority. Take care not to persuade yourself that what I write to you comes from
the ill-offices of the Intendant. It results from what I fully know from everything
which reaches me from Canada, proving but too well what you are doing there. The
Bishop, the ecclesiastics, the Jesuit Fathers, the supreme council, and, in a word, everybody,
complain of you; but I am willing to believe that you will change your conduct,
and act with the moderation necessary for the good of the colony.”</p>

<p class="p1">Frontenac felt the ground slipping under him, but he continued his
suicidal policy, while he wrote to some friends in France to recount his
woes, and to solicit their good offices with the Court.</p>

<p>Seignelay came to power in 1681. He was the son of Colbert, and a
man of very good abilities, matured under the eye of the great minister.
He soon received long letters from
Frontenac and the Intendant, filled
with accusations and countercharges.
Affairs had gone badly
during the spring and summer of
1681. Some blows were struck,
and a resort to sharper weapons
was hinted at. The Intendant,
Frontenac said, had barricaded his
house and armed his servants.
Duchesneau declared that his son
had been beaten by the Governor for a slight offence, and afterward imprisoned
in the château for a month, despite the pleadings of the Bishop
in his behalf. These matters, and much more, were regularly reported to
the new minister. Both officials stated that furs had been carried to the
English settlements, and each blamed the other for it. The Intendant
maintained that the faction led by Frontenac had spread among the Indians
a rumor of a pestilence at Montreal, for the purpose of keeping them away
from the fair, and in order that the bushrangers might purchase the beaver-skins
at a low price. The allegation was groundless, but it had its effect
at court. The King, tired at last of the constant strife, recalled both
Frontenac and Duchesneau in the following year.</p>

</div>

<p>Frontenac’s successor was Le Fèbvre de la Barre, a soldier of repute
who had already rendered his country good service in the West Indian
war, where he had gained
some notable successes
against the English. For
reducing Antigua and
Montserrat and recapturing Cayenne from
the enemy, he had been promoted to a
lieutenant-generalship. He arrived at Quebec with Meules, his intendant,
at a most inopportune time. The great fire of August 4, 1682, had laid
waste fifty-five houses, and destroyed vast quantities of goods.</p>

<div class="floatright">
     <img src="images/ill-337d.jpg" width="200" height="57" id="i337c"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>The new Governor took up his residence
in the château, while Meules went
to live in a house in the woods.
La Barre was a very different
man from Frontenac. He had
nothing of that soldier’s peculiar energy or determination. He was a
temporizer, cold and insincere, and no match for Indian diplomacy or
duplicity. The Indians gauged his capacity before he had been in
Canada many weeks, and as compared with Frontenac they felt that
they had a child to deal with. The King had given him pretty plain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
instructions. He was ordered not only to apply himself to prevent the
violence of the Iroquois against the French, but also to endeavor to keep
the savages at peace among themselves, and by all means to prevent the
Iroquois from making war on the Illinois and other tribes. He was
further told that his Majesty did not attach much importance to the
discoveries which had lately been made in the countries of the Nadoussioux,
the River Mississippi, and other parts of North America, deeming
them of but slight utility; but he enjoined that the Sieur de la Salle be
permitted to complete the exploration he had commenced, as far as the
mouth of the Mississippi, “in case he consider, after having examined
into it with the Intendant, that such discovery can be of any utility.”</p>

<p>It was not long before La Barre exhibited his total incapacity for governing
Canada. He lowered the French prestige in the eyes of the
Indians of the Confederacy, and left his red allies to their fate. He was
jealous of La Salle, and hated him cordially. Charlevoix accounts for
his incapacity by saying that “his advanced age made him credulous
when he ought to be distrustful, timid when he ought to be bold, dark
and cautious towards those who deserved his confidence, and deprived
him of the energy necessary to act as the critical condition of the colony
demanded when he administered its affairs.” He was not very old, being
little more than sixty years of age at the time. He found the Iroquois
flushed with victory over their enemies, and displaying an arrogant
bearing towards the French. He wrote a braggart letter to the King;
said that with twelve hundred men he would attack twenty-six hundred
Iroquois, and then begged for more troops. To the minister he wrote that
war was imminent, and unless those “haughty conquerors” were opposed,
“half our trade and all our reputation” would be lost. He was always
talking about fighting; but those about him knew that he rarely meant
all he said. He developed a remarkable predilection for trade, and soon
after his arrival allied himself to several of the Quebec merchants, with
that object in view. This gave grave offence to all those who could not
participate. The tables were turned, and the old enemies of Frontenac
now reigned, while La Salle and La Forêt were deposed. Du Lhut, the
leader of the <i>coureurs de bois</i>, and a quondam friend of the Ex-Governor,
transferred his allegiance to the new authority. La Barre soon showed his
feeling towards La Salle. Jacques Le Ber and Aubert de la Chesnaye were
early despatched to Fort Frontenac, which La Forêt commanded, with
orders to seize it and all it contained, on the flimsy pretext that La Salle
had failed to fulfil the conditions of his contract. La Forêt was offered his
former position as commander of the fort; but he refused to be false to
his chief, and sailed for France in high dudgeon.</p>

<p>On the 10th of October a conference on the state of affairs with the Iroquois
was held. There were present the Governor, Intendant, Bishop of
Quebec, M. Dollier, Superior of the Seminary of St. Sulpice of Montreal,
Father Dablon, the Governor of Three Rivers, and others. The meeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
was harmonious, and the importance and danger of the situation seemed
to be understood. A most uninviting prospect lay before the little colony.
The Iroquois, well armed and equipped, could strike first the Illinois, and
in turn all the tribes in alliance with the French, and so divert the peltry
trade into other channels, and finally fall upon the French themselves. It
was stated at the conference that the English were responsible for this, and
that they had been urging the Iroquois on for four years, in order to ruin
Canada, and to secure for themselves and the Dutch the entire peltry trade
of the continent. It was determined to make an effort to prevent the
Iroquois from bringing upon the friendly Indians the fate they had previously
dealt upon the Algonquins, the Andastes, the Abenaquis, and
others. It was finally thought that the war might be averted for a time,
and meanwhile the King was urgently importuned for troops and two
hundred hired men, besides arms and ammunition.</p>

<p>The attack came sooner than had been expected. In the early spring
the Seneca Indians were reported to be moving in considerable force on
the Illinois, the Hurons, and the Ottawas of the lakes. La Barre, greatly
excited, hastened his preparations. He wrote to France, explaining the
posture of affairs, and demanding more troops. Du Lhut was sent with
thirty men, with powder and lead, to Michillimackinac, to strengthen the
defences there, and to guard the stores, of which there was a great quantity.
Charles Le Moyne was despatched to Onondaga with a mission, which
so far succeeded that forty-three Iroquois chiefs went to Montreal to meet
the Governor. They arrived on the 14th of August. A council was held,
and over two thousand crowns’ worth of presents were distributed among
the Indians. La Barre demanded friendship for the Ottawas, the Algonquins,
and the Hurons; but there was no firmness in his demands. He
was timid, and when the fierce Senecas declared that the Iroquois made
war on the Illinois because they deserved to die, he said nothing, and his
silence sealed their doom. The delegates were asked to agree not to
plunder French traders who were provided with passports. They agreed
to this. It was a suggestion of La Chesnaye, and evidently aimed at La
Salle, though La Barre denied that he gave the Iroquois liberty to plunder
and kill the explorer. By a sort of poetic justice, the first captures the
Iroquois made under their agreement were two boats belonging to La
Chesnaye, which had gone up the lakes during Frontenac’s reign, and
had no passports. On the 30th of August the deputies left Montreal.</p>

<p>La Barre continued his trading operations. He and La Chesnaye
anticipated the annual market at Montreal, by sending up a large fleet
of vessels, and securing enormous quantities of furs, a great part of
which was clandestinely sent to Albany and New York. The Governor’s
persecutions of La Salle went on, and in the spring he sent the Chevalier
de Baugis, with canoes and soldiers, to seize his fort of St. Louis;
but his scheme suffered defeat. La Barre now prepared in earnest for
war, and was resolved to attack the Senecas in the following August<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
(1684). On the 31st of July the King wrote that he had sent him
three hundred soldiers.</p>

<p>It has been said that the English colonists of New York had instigated
the Iroquois to make war on the French. Colonel Thomas Dongan,
Lord Tyrconnel’s nephew, and a Roman Catholic, was governor of New
York. Though he had respect for the King of France, he nevertheless
thought himself entitled to a share of the fur-trade, which had so long
remained a monopoly of the Canadians, and he decided to make some
effort to obtain it. The Duke of York warned him against offending the
French governor; but while Dongan publicly professed to observe his
Grace’s injunction, he was really in frequent intrigue with the enemies of
the French, and did all he could to provoke the Iroquois into making war
on La Barre and his allies. The English had secured the allegiance of the
five tribes of the Confederacy; the hatchet had been buried, and the song
of peace had been sung. Dongan was wily, and got the Iroquois to
recognize his king as their lawful sovereign. This would give him the
command of the country south of the great lakes. The Indians readily
promised, but without any intention of keeping their word. Their motive
evidently was to make the most out of either party, and yield nothing.
La Barre complained of the Senecas and Cayugas, and wrote to Dongan,
telling him not to sell the offenders any arms or ammunition, and saying
that he meant to attack the tribes for plundering French canoes and
attempting a French fort. Dongan wrote in reply that the Iroquois were
British subjects, and if they had done wrong, reparation should be made.
Meanwhile he urged La Barre not to make his threatened attack, and
begged him to keep the peace between the two colonies. Next he laid
the complaints of the French governor before the chiefs, who on their
part declared that the French had carried arms to their foes, the Illinois
and the Miamis. Dongan handled the question with tact, and played
upon the fears of the Indians so well that he got them to consent to his
placing the arms of the Duke of York in their villages, which he said
would save them from the French. They further agreed that they would
not make peace with Onontio without consent of the English. In return
for this, Dongan promised aid in case their country should be invaded.</p>

<p>The English Governor was a believer in prompt action, and he hastened
to have the Iroquois’ subjection to King Charles confirmed. To that end
he despatched a Dutch interpreter, Arnold Viele by name, to Onondaga.
But Charles Le Moyne and the crafty Jesuit Jean de Lamberville, who
knew the Indian character well, were there before the envoy of the English
arrived. Le Moyne had been sent to invite the tribes to a conference with
La Barre. The chief of the Onondagas was Otréouati, or Big Mouth,
a famous orator and influential warrior, and ranking as one of the ablest
Indians of the Confederacy. He was unscrupulous as regards keeping
promises, but his valor and astuteness were beyond question. The two
Frenchmen had spent some days in trying to induce the Onondagas to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
their Seneca confederates to make peace with the French. The Senecas
at first would not hear of it; but finally they succumbed to Big Mouth’s
eloquence, and gave the Onondagas power to complete a treaty for them.
Viele appeared on the scene; but he was no diplomat, and he shocked the
pride of the Onondagas when he told them, with more arrogance than
policy, that the English were masters of their territory, and that they had
no right to hold council with the French without permission. It was
natural that Big Mouth should become indignant: he asserted the independence
of his tribe, and told his warriors and chiefs not to listen to the
proposals of a man who seemed to be drunk, so opposed to all reason was
what he uttered. The end of it was that Big Mouth and his sachems
consented to accompany Le Moyne to meet La Barre.</p>

<p>The French Governor was ready for the campaign, having seven hundred
Canadians, a hundred and thirty regulars, and two hundred mission
Indians under his command. He was to be reinforced by a band of Indians
on the way, and a company of <i>coureurs de bois</i> led by Du Lhut and La
Durantaye. More warriors were to join him at Niagara. He declared that
he intended to exterminate the Senecas; but his Intendant, Meules, had no
faith in his promises, and kept urging him on, as if he feared that he would
make peace without striking a blow,&mdash;a fatal course in his eyes. He wrote
to the Governor two letters on the subject, concluding the second one thus:
“If we do not destroy them, they will destroy us. I think you see but too
well that your honor and the safety of the country are involved in the results
of this war.” He also sent a despatch to Seignelay, which contained
the customary complaints against La Barre, and some vigorous comments
on his conduct in trading against the orders of the King, and his warlike
pretensions which meant nothing. “I will take the liberty to tell you,
Monseigneur,” he wrote, “though I am no prophet, that I discover no disposition
on the part of Monsieur the General to make war against the aforesaid
savages. In my belief, he will content himself by going in a canoe as
far as Fort Frontenac, and then send for the Senecas to treat of peace with
them, and deceive the people, the Intendant, and, if I may be allowed with
all possible respect to say so, his Majesty himself.” La Barre proceeded
on his way with his army, and after encountering a few adventures <i>en route</i>,
finally reached Fort Frontenac, where the whole party encamped. A malarial
fever broke out among the French, and many died. La Barre himself
was greatly reduced and wasted by the disease, and so disheartened that
he abandoned his plans, and sought to secure peace on the most favorable
terms that he could get. He no longer thought of punishing the Senecas,
nor had he the courage to invite them to council. He crossed over to
La Famine with a few men, and sent Le Moyne to beg the tribes to meet
him on their side of the lake. Here provisions grew scarce, and hunger
and discontent prevailed among his followers. Several soldiers languished
through disease; others died.</p>

<p>La Barre awaited the return of his envoy with fear and suspense. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
at last he came on the third of the month, with Big Mouth and thirteen
deputies, the Governor received the party with what grace he could. He
had sent his sick men away, and told the Indians that his army was at Fort
Frontenac; but the keen-witted savages were not deceived, and one of their
number, understanding French, gathered during the evening from the conversation
of the soldiers the true condition of affairs. The council was held
on the 4th of September; and Baron La Hontan, who was present, gives
a long account of what took place. The Governor related the offences of
the Iroquois; charged them with maltreating and robbing the French
traders in the country of the Illinois, with introducing the “English into
the lakes which belong to the King, my master, and among the tribes who
are his children, in order to destroy the trade of his subjects,” and with
having made “several barbarous inroads into the country of the Illinois
and Miamis, seizing, binding, and leading into captivity an infinite number
of those savages in time of peace.... They are the children of my king,”
he said, “and are not to remain your slaves. They must at once be set free
and sent home.” Should such things occur again, he was ordered, he said,
to declare war against the offending tribes. He agreed to grant them terms
of peace, provided they made atonement for the past, and promised good
conduct for the future; otherwise he would burn their villages and destroy
them. Big Mouth rose and replied. He very soon convinced La Barre of
the hopelessness of his task. “Listen, Onontio,” he said. “I am not asleep,
my eyes are open; and by the sun that gives me light I see a great captain
at the head of a band of soldiers who talks like a man in a dream. He
says that he has come to smoke the pipe of peace with the Onondagas;
but I see that he came to knock them in the head if so many of his Frenchmen
were not too weak to fight. I see Onontio raving in a camp of sick
men, whose lives the Great Spirit has saved by smiting them with disease.
Our women had snatched war-clubs, and our children and old men seized
bows and arrows, to attack your camp, if our warriors had not restrained
them, when your messenger, Akouessan, appeared in our village.” The
savage refused reparation; said that his tribe had been born free, and that
they depended on neither Onontio nor on Corlaer, the governor of New
York. “We have knocked the Illinois in the head,” he continued, “because
they cut down the tree of peace and hunted the beaver on our lands.
We have done less than the English and the French, who have seized upon
the lands of many tribes, driven them away, and built towns, villages, and
forts in the country.” La Barre, greatly disgusted, retired to his tent,
and the council closed. In the afternoon another session was held, and
in the evening a treaty was patched up. Big Mouth agreed to some reparation,
which, however, he never made; but he would not consent to make
peace with La Barre’s allies, the Illinois, whom he declared he would fight
to the death. He also demanded that the council fire should be removed
from Fort Frontenac to La Famine,&mdash;a concession yielded by La Barre
without hesitation, but which Frontenac would never have granted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

<p>The Governor returned home the next day, broken and dispirited; his
men followed, wasted by fever and hunger, as best they could. This disgraceful
truce was treated with contempt by all, the allies of the French
included; and for a while it was thought that the friendly tribes would
go over to the enemy in a body, make peace with their old rivals, and
divert the channel of trade from Montreal to Albany. Lamberville
only indorsed the Governor’s conduct, and styled him the “savior of the
country” for having made peace at so critical a time. Meules and the
others viewed the matter differently, and the former wrote to the minister
that the Governor’s excuses were a mere pretence; that he had lost his
wits, had gone off in a fright, and since his return his officers could not
abstain from showing him the contempt in which they held him. The King,
much annoyed, recalled La Barre, and the Marquis de Denonville, a
colonel in the Queen’s regiment of Dragoons, full of piety and a devoted
friend of the Jesuits, was sent to succeed him.</p>

<p>Denonville had been thirty years a soldier, and was much esteemed at
court for his valor. It was agreed on all hands that the King’s selection
of him for governor of the troubled colony was a very good one. But
results proved it otherwise; and Denonville’s administration was even more
unfortunate than that of La Barre, whose disastrous reign had brought
Canada almost to the brink of ruin. When he arrived at Quebec in the
autumn of 1685, with his wife and a portion of his family, he found little to
cheer him. One hundred and fifty of the five hundred soldiers who had
been sent out to Canada by King Louis had perished of scurvy while
crossing the sea. The colony was in great disorder; the Iroquois roamed
at their pleasure, destroyed when and whom they pleased, and vented their
anger with all the cruelty and ferocity of their savage nature on such tribes
as favored the French. The Indian allies of the French who had been
abandoned by La Barre had little respect left for the nation whose chief
representative had so badly served them. But now all this would be
changed. Denonville was ordered to ratify the peace with the Iroquois or
to declare war, the alternative being left to his own discretion. The King,
who felt acutely the disgrace
of La Barre’s abandonment of
the Illinois, enjoined the new
governor to repair that mischief
as speedily as possible, to sustain the friendly
tribes, and to humble the Iroquois at all hazards.
A vigorous policy was determined on, and the
King had great faith in the instrument which was
to effect it. Denonville was given especial instructions regarding the English
of New York, who at this time were constantly intriguing with the enemies
of New France. Dongan understood the country well, and was striving
with all his energy to secure control of the valuable fur districts south of
the Great Lakes. To that end he was always in treaty with the Iroquois,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
who promised and disregarded their promises as exigency or humor suited
them. The King was fully aware of this, and his instructions of March 10,
1685, are especially clear on this point. First, the French ambassador at
London, M. Barillon, was desired to demand from the King of England
“precise orders obliging that Governor [Dongan] to confine himself within
the limits of his government, and to observe a different line of conduct
toward Sieur de Denonville, whom his Majesty has chosen to succeed
said Sieur de la Barre.” And Denonville was himself told that “everything
must be done to maintain good understanding between the French
and English; but if the latter, contrary to all appearances, excite and
aid the Indians, they must be treated as enemies when found on Indian
territory, without, at the same time, attempting anything on territory
under the obedience of the King of England.” Meanwhile, the English
were seizing posts in Acadia<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> which had always been occupied by the
French. Denonville was ordered to send to the governor at Boston to
explain the points of boundary, and to request him to confine himself to
his own limits in future. Perrot, the former governor of Montreal, was now
governor of Acadia, and he was instructed to keep up a correspondence
with Denonville, and to take his orders from him.<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a></p>

<p>The struggle for the supremacy was between Denonville and Dongan.
The latter dared not act as openly as he wished, for his King, being often at
the mercy of Louis, kept saddling him with mandates which he could not
disobey, though they sorely touched his pride. He could, however, intrigue;
and the convenient Iroquois, who found their gain in the dissensions
of the English and French, and who soon learned to encourage the rivalry
between the two white powers encroaching on their domain, turned listening
ears to his words. Louis favored the schemes of Denonville, which had
been formed on a very extensive scale, and involved the mastery of the
most fruitful part of the entire continent. New York had at this time about
18,000 inhabitants; Canada’s population was 12,263; but while the latter
people were united in furthering French aims, the inhabitants of New York,
save the active traders of the colony who were concerned in the purchase of
peltries, took very little interest in Dongan’s plans. The English colonies
were all deeply interested in checking French advancement, but they declined
to help the government of New York, and Dongan was forced to
fight his battles single-handed. His king furnished him neither money nor
troops; but the assistance rendered, though sometimes in a negative sense,
by the Iroquois league, was often formidable enough, and served his purpose
on occasion. On the part of Denonville there were, of course, counter-intrigues.
Through Lamberville he distributed presents to the Iroquois,
and Engelran spent many days at Michillimackinac trying to stay the
Hurons, Ottawas, and other lake tribes from allying themselves with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
English, as they threatened to do. It was clear that a bold stroke must be
made to keep these hitherto friendly tribes on the side of the French, and
the only means which seemed to be open was war with the Iroquois. The
latter were also intriguing with their old enemies, and trying to make
treaties independently of the French. The <i>coureurs de bois</i>, too, were a
source of danger and annoyance. La Barre had not kept them in check,
and Denonville speedily discovered that they acted as though they regarded
the edicts of the King as so much waste paper. It was impossible to prevent
their selling brandy to the Indians, and demoralizing and debauching
the tribes. Denonville wrote for more troops, and seemed anxious to deal
a decisive blow at the Iroquois. Affairs were in a deplorable state, and
nothing short of a stalwart exhibition of French power would save the
country. “Nothing can save us,” wrote the Governor, “but the sending
out of troops and the building of forts and blockhouses. Yet I dare not
begin to build them; for if I do, it will bring down all the Iroquois upon
us before we are in a condition to fight them.”</p>

<p>A brisk correspondence sprang up between the Governor of New York and
Denonville. At first it was polite and complimentary, but ere long it assumed
a sterner character, and strong language was employed on both sides.
A good deal of fencing was indulged in. There were charges and countercharges.
Each blamed the other for keeping bad faith, and each side made
every effort to out-manœuvre the other. Denonville saw with military
prescience that forts would be of service at several important points. One
of these sites was situate on the straits of Detroit, and he hastened to send
Du Lhut with fifty men to occupy it. The active woodsman promptly built
a stockade at the outlet of Lake Huron, on the western side of the strait,
and paused there for a while. News reached Denonville that Dongan
contemplated sending, early in the spring of 1687, an armed expedition in
the direction of Michillimackinac to forestall the trade there. He complained
to the Governor of New York, and advised the King about it. To
Du Lhut he issued orders to shoot down the intruders so soon as they
presented themselves. Dongan dissembled until he heard from England,
when he altered his tone, and wrote a letter much subdued in temper to
Denonville. The French Governor replied, and counselled harmony.</p>

<p>Intelligence from the north reached Denonville about this time, which
gave him considerable satisfaction. The French had resolved in the spring
of 1686 to assert their right to the territory of Hudson’s Bay. An English
Company had established a post at the mouth of Nelson River, on the west,
and on the southern end there were situate forts Albany, Hayes, and
Rupert, each garrisoned by a few men. The rival of this Company was the
Company of the North, a Canadian institution, which held a grant from
Louis XIV. The French had decided to expel the English from their posts,
and Denonville approved the plan, and sent Chevalier de Troyes with a
band of eighty men to assist the Company. Forts Hayes and Rupert were
assaulted at night. In each instance the attack was a surprise, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
posts readily fell into the hands of the invaders. Several of the English
were killed, others were wounded, and the rest were made prisoners. Iberville
attacked a vessel anchored near the fort; three of its defenders were
killed, and others, including Bridger, the governor for the Company, were
captured. At Fort Albany, which was garrisoned by thirty men, a stouter
resistance was offered, but at the end of an hour it was silenced, and shared
the fate of its fellows.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a treaty of neutrality had been signed at Whitehall, and there
was peace between England and France for a time. The document bears
date Nov. 16, 1686. On Jan. 22, 1687, instructions were sent to Governor
Dongan to maintain friendly relations with Denonville, and to give him no
cause for complaint. The King of France delayed despatching his orders
to Canada until four months had elapsed.</p>

</div>

<p>Denonville was ordered to punish the Iroquois. He had eight hundred
regulars, and a further contingent of eight hundred men were promised in
the spring. Abundant means, too, had been provided; namely, 168,000
livres in money and supplies. Denonville was in high feather, and everything
turned in his favor for a time. He had got rid of his meddling Intendant,
Meules, and a pious man like himself had been sent in his place.
This was Champigny. The Bishop, St. Vallier, had only words of praise for
the administration as it then stood: Church and State were in perfect harmony
at last. The attack on the Iroquois towns was well planned, and
every precaution was observed to keep the matter secret until the time for
action had arrived. Dongan, however, learned the truth from straggling
deserters, and he was not slow in informing the Iroquois of the warlike
designs of the French.</p>

<p>Denonville’s plan was to proceed to the Senecas, the strongest castle
and the nearest to Niagara, his course taking him along the southern shore,
which he elected on account of certain advantages which it possessed over
the northern side. The little army moved out from Montreal on its career
of conquest June 13, 1687. After some difficulty, Fort Frontenac was
reached. Champigny and his men had arrived a few days in advance of
the main army;
and through his exertions
thirty men
and ninety women
and children of a
peaceable tribe belonging to the Iroquois and living in the neighborhood,
were decoyed into the fort under the pretence of being feasted, and treacherously
captured. Other Indians were taken in the same way, many of
whom were afterward consigned to the French galleys. The Iroquois were
more chivalrous. They had Lamberville, the Jesuit missionary whom Denonville
had basely left to his fate, in their power, and could easily have
destroyed him, but they allowed him to go free and join his friends. At
the fort there were assembled, according to Denonville, about two thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
men, regulars, militia, and Indians. Eight hundred troops, newly arrived
from France, had been left at Montreal to protect the settlers and property
there. More allies were awaiting his commands at Niagara; they consisted
of one hundred and eighty Frenchmen, and four hundred Indians, under
Tonty, La Durantaye, and Du Lhut. The journey to Niagara had not
been made without hardship and adventure. The Indians of the party had
been difficult to manage, and for a while Durantaye was not sure that they
would remain with him. Some of the English traders, commanded by
Johannes Rooseboom, a Dutchman, on the way to Michillimackinac with
goods, were encountered, and Durantaye hastened with one hundred and
twenty <i>coureurs de bois</i> to meet them. The party, consisting of twenty-nine
whites and five Mohawks and Mohicans, were threatened with death if they
resisted. They immediately surrendered, and were despatched to Michillimackinac
as prisoners. The merchandise they brought was parcelled out
among the Indians. This stroke was the means of saving Durantaye’s life,
and the Indians with him became in consequence his sure allies. While
making for Niagara, McGregory’s canoes were met, and the same fate overtook
them. This capture proved important, for McGregory had with him
a number of Ottawa and Huron prisoners whom the Iroquois had taken.
It was the Englishman’s intention to restore these captives to their countrymen,
to make good the terms of the triple alliance which had been entered
into by the English, the Iroquois, and the lake tribes. McGregory’s capture
destroyed the whole arrangement, and he and his companions, with
those of Rooseboom, were ultimately sent as prisoners to Quebec.</p>

<p>The war-party at Niagara were ordered to repair to the rendezvous at
Irondequoit Bay, on the border of the Seneca country, and Denonville went
to meet them. His command numbered three thousand men, for a reinforcement
of Ottawas of Michillimackinac who had refused to follow Durantaye,
having altered their minds, now joined the party. The host was
well officered. The leaders were Denonville, the Chevalier de Vaudreuil,&mdash;an
excellent soldier, fresh from France,&mdash;La Durantaye, Callières, Du
Lhut, Tonty, Berthier, La Valterie, Granville, Longueil, La Hontan, De
Troyes, and others. On the afternoon of the 12th of July, at three o’clock,
having already despatched four hundred men to garrison the redoubt, which
had been put in a condition of defence for the protection of the provisions
and canoes, Denonville began his march across the woods to Gannagaro,&mdash;twenty-two
miles distant. Each man carried with him food for thirteen
days. Three leagues were made the first day, and the party camped for the
night. Two defiles were passed the next morning. The heat was intense,
and the mosquitoes were very troublesome, but the men moved on in pretty
fair order. So far, only a few scouts of the enemy had been encountered.
At two o’clock the third defile was entered. It had been the Governor’s
intention to rest here, but having been notified by scouts that a considerable
party of the Senecas was in the neighborhood, an advance was made
by Callières, who was at the head of the three companies commanded by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
Tonty, Durantaye, and Du Lhut, besides the detachment of Indians. This
body, which formed the vanguard of the army, pushed rapidly through the
defile, unconscious of the fact that an ambuscade of Senecas, three hundred
strong, was posted in the vicinity. When they reached the end they came
upon a thicket of alders and rank grass. At a given signal, the air was rent
with defiant shouts, and a host of savages leaped from their places of concealment,
and sent a volley of lead into the bewildered French, while the
three hundred Senecas who lined the sides of the defile sprang upon the
van. They had thought to crush their enemy at a blow, but Denonville,
hurrying up with his sixteen hundred men, soon spread consternation into
their ranks. The firing was heavy on both sides; but the Senecas were
defeated with considerable slaughter, and finally fled from the scene in dismay.
Denonville wrote that “all our Christian Indians from below performed
their duty admirably, and firmly maintained the position assigned
to them on the left.” The French did
not follow the flying savages, being too
much fatigued by their long march.
Their loss was five or six men killed and twenty wounded. Among the
latter was Father Engelran, who was seriously injured by a bullet.</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-348.jpg" width="200" height="35" id="i348"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>The next morning the army pressed forward again, but no Seneca warriors
were to be seen. The villages were deserted, and ten days were occupied
by the soldiers and their allies in reducing the Indian villages and
destroying the provisions and stores which the Senecas had left behind them.
Denonville withdrew on the 24th with his army, and set out for Montreal.
On the way back he ordered a stockade to be built at Niagara, on the
site of La Salle’s old fort, between the River Niagara and Lake Ontario.
Montreal was reached on the 13th of August.<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a></p>

<p>Denonville thought that he had made a successful stroke; but he was
over sanguine. After this his power seemed to wane, and his prestige went
down. Dongan was savage when he heard of the imprisonment of McGregory
and Rooseboom, and wrote a sharp letter demanding their return.
Denonville refused, and upbraided him for having assisted the savages.
He thought better of his resolution as his anger cooled, however, and in
a few weeks released his prisoners.</p>

<p>Dongan called a conference of the Iroquois, and told them to receive no
more Jesuit missionaries into their towns. He called them British subjects,
and said that they should make no treaties with the French without asking
leave of King James. The humbled Indians promised obedience.</p>

<p>Hitherto, Dongan had not succeeded in getting his king to recognize
the Iroquois as his subjects. On the 10th of November, 1687, however, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
warrant arrived from England authorizing the Governor to protect the Five
Nations, and to repel the French from their territory by force of arms,
should they attack the villages again. The commissioners appointed, in
accordance with the terms of the neutrality treaty signed at Whitehall, had
the boundary question before them. Both French and English claimed the
Iroquois, and the matter was assuming a serious aspect. News came in
August, 1688, to Denonville, that the subject of dispute would receive
prompt and satisfactory settlement.<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the French Governor made several overtures to obtain peace
with the Iroquois; but their demands were greater than his pride could
grant. Dongan’s hand was seen in every proposition formulated by the
savages. Father Vaillant was sent to Albany to try and obtain easier conditions,
but the effort was vain; and the Iroquois absolutely refused to make
peace or grant a truce until Fort Niagara was razed, and all the prisoners
restored. These terms were exasperating; but when Denonville learned
that Dongan had been recalled by King James, his spirits rose, and he felt
as if a great load were removed. The governments of New York, New
Jersey, and New England became one administration, and Sir Edmund
Andros was named governor over all. So far as Denonville was concerned,
he was no better off than before, for the new Governor insisted on all of
Dongan’s old demands being satisfied, and actually forbade peace with the
Iroquois on any other basis.</p>

<p>The state of Canada at this time, 1688, was most deplorable. Disease
had broken out, and the mortality was fearful. Before spring, ten only, out
of a garrison of one hundred men at Niagara, survived the scourge. The
provisions had become bad, and prowling Senecas prevented any of the
inmates of the fort from venturing out to look for food. Fort Frontenac’s
garrison was also sadly diminished, and the distress throughout the country,
from famine and disease, was very great. To add to the Governor’s troubles,
the fur-trade had languished. Bands of Iroquois menaced the unfortunate
settlers. The fields were untilled; danger lurked in every bush, and destitution,
gaunt and grim, abounded everywhere. Peace must be had at any
price, if the colony would live, and Denonville resolved to make it. He had
become unmanned by his trials, and though he still had a force of fourteen
hundred regulars, some militia, and three or four hundred Indian converts,
he hesitated to venture on war. He wrote to the Court for eight hundred
more troops, and the King sent him three hundred. Then he made up his
mind to fight. He planned a campaign against the Iroquois which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
hoped would break their power. He proposed to divide his army into two
sections, with one of which he might crush the Onondagas and Cayugas,
and with the other the Mohawks and Oneidas. He asked the King for four
thousand troops, and the Bishop backed his demand with an earnest prayer;
but France could not spare them, and the Governor was left to his own resources.
He fell back on the arts of the diplomat, and invited the wily old
chief Big Mouth, to a council at Montreal. The savage consented to come,
despite his promises to the English, and presently he appeared before
Denonville at the head of twelve hundred warriors. He addressed the
Marquis haughtily, and said that he would make peace with the French,
but the terms would not include their allies: the Iroquois must be left free
to attack them when and how they would. Denonville, like De la Barre on a
former occasion, dared not refuse, and the red allies of the Governor were
again abandoned to their fate. A declaration of neutrality was drawn up
June 15, 1688, and Big Mouth promised that deputies from the whole Confederacy
should proceed to Montreal and sign a general peace.</p>

<p>A chief of the Hurons named Kondiaronk, or the Rat, heard of the
treaty about to be made. Should it be ratified, it meant the destruction of
his own tribe. He took steps to prevent it, and with a band of trusty savages
intercepted the Iroquois deputies on their way to Montreal, at La Famine,
and attacked them. One chief was killed, a warrior escaped with a
broken arm, and the rest were wounded and taken prisoners. The Rat told
his captives that Denonville had informed him that they were to pass that
way, and when the captives replied that they were envoys of peace, the
crafty Huron assumed an injured air, liberated them all save one, and giving
them guns and ammunition, told them to go back to their people, and
avenge the treachery of the French. They departed, breathing vengeance
against Onontio. The wounded Iroquois who had been in the <i>mêlée</i> escaped,
however, learned a different story at Fort Frontenac, where he was
well received, and hastened to Onondaga charged with explanations. The
Iroquois pretended to be satisfied, and Denonville believed them; but ere
long he was terribly undeceived. From one pretext and another, the treaty
was not signed.</p>

<p>And now occurred one of the direst and blackest tragedies in the annals
of New France. During the night and morning of the 4th and 5th of August,
1689, some fourteen or fifteen hundred Iroquois landed at Lachine.
A tempest was raging at the time, and taking advantage of the storm and
the darkness, they crept noiselessly up to the houses of the sleeping settlers,
and, yelling their piercing war-whoop, fell upon their defenceless and surprised
victims. The houses were fired, and the massacre of the inmates
which followed was swift and frightful. Few escaped; men, women, and
children were indiscriminately slain in cold blood. It is estimated that more
than two hundred persons were butchered outright, and one hundred and
twenty were carried off as prisoners and reserved for a fate worse than death.
Women were impaled, children roasted by slow fires, and other horrors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
were perpetrated. Three stockade forts, Rémy, Roland, and La Présentation,
respectably garrisoned, were situate in the vicinity of this bloody deed.
Two hundred regular troops were encamped less than three miles away.
Their officer, Subercase, was at the time in Montreal, some six miles from
his command. A fugitive from the massacre alarmed the soldiers, and then
fled to Montreal with his terrible news. Flying victims of the tragedy were
seen at intervals pursued by Iroquois, but the presence of the file of soldiers
prevented them from following up their prey. It was far into the day when
Subercase returned, breathless, from Montreal. He hastily ordered his
troops to push on, and, reinforced by one hundred armed settlers and
several men from the forts, marched towards the encampment of the Indians.
Most of the latter were helplessly drunk by this time, and Subercase could
have killed many of them easily; but just as he was about to strike, Chevalier
de Vaudreuil appeared upon the scene, and by orders of Denonville
commanded the gallant officer to stand solely on the defensive. In vain
Subercase protested; but the orders of his superior could not be gainsaid.
The troops were marched back to Fort Roland, a great opportunity for
revenge was lost, and the fatal pause cost the French very dearly. The
next day the savages were early on the alert. Eighty men hurrying from
Fort Rémy to join Vaudreuil were cut to pieces, and only Le Moyne, De
Longueil, and a few others succeeded in making their way through the gate
of the fort which they had just abandoned. The Indians continued their
fiendish work. They burned all the houses and barns within an area of nine
miles, and pillaged and scalped, without opposition, within a circle of
twenty miles. The miserable policy of Denonville completely paralyzed
the troops and inhabitants, and they allowed the Iroquois to remain in the
neighborhood until they had surfeited themselves with slaughter, though
with a little determined effort they could readily have driven them off. At
length the savages withdrew of their own accord, and as they passed the
forts they called out loud enough for the inmates to hear, “Onontio, you
deceived us, and now we have deceived you.”</p>

<p>Other troubles overtook the colony: the rebellion broke out in England;
war was declared between Britain and France, in the midst of which Denonville
was recalled, and brave, chivalrous Frontenac, now in his seventieth
year, crossed the seas again, his past conduct forgiven by King Louis, to
administer for a second time the affairs of Canada.</p>

<p>It was in the autumn of 1689, and by evening, that Frontenac was
received at Quebec with fireworks and jubilations. His passage had been
long, and the season was too far advanced to render it practicable to
organize an attack on New York by sea and land, in accordance with
secret instructions which he had received on leaving France;<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> so the condition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
of affairs in Canada at once engaged his attention. These were far
from cheerful. Frontenac hastened to Montreal, only to meet the garrison
of Fort Frontenac, which had abandoned and partially destroyed the works,
and were withdrawing under Denonville’s orders. In every direction the
settlements were in terror of the stealthy Iroquois; and even the tribes
of the lakes, having found under Denonville’s policy that little dependence
could be placed in the support of the French, were showing signs of revolt.
Frontenac had induced a council of the Iroquois; but his proposition for
peace was only met by the revelation of their alliance with the tribes of
Michillimackinac. The French Governor acted promptly: he despatched
a force, accompanied by the astute Nicholas Perrot, to endeavor to prevent
any overt act on the part of the Ottawas.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, to punish the English and to impress the savages, Frontenac
sent out three expeditions. The first, from Montreal, fell suddenly upon
Schenectady, then the farthest outpost of the English in New York, and
perpetrated a fearful massacre. The invaders retired, not without pursuit,
leaving some prisoners in the hands of the English, who learned from them
that Frontenac designed to make a more formidable attack in the spring.
Schuyler, of Albany, appealed to Massachusetts for help; but the New
England colonies soon had a sharper appeal for their own defence. Towards
the end of January, Frontenac’s second expedition had left Three
Rivers, and two months later it fell suddenly upon Salmon Falls, a settlement
on the river dividing Maine from New Hampshire, where the force
plundered and killed whom they could, and retreated so as to intercept and
join the third of the French parties, which had left Quebec in January, and
was now on its way to attack Fort Loyal, at the present Portland. After
a vigorous resistance, Captain Sylvanus Davis, a Massachusetts man, who
commanded the English, surrendered that post upon terms which were not
kept. Murder and rapine followed, as in the other cases, while Davis and
some others were led captive to Canada. Frontenac received the New
Englander kindly, who was still in his power when another and more
famous New Englander appeared before Quebec with a fleet, in pursuance
of a part of a plan of attack on New France which the English were now
bent on making in retaliation. At a congress in May, 1690, held in New
York, the scheme was arranged. A land force under Fitz-John Winthrop
was to march from Albany to Montreal. It fell (as we shall see) by the
way, and disappeared. A sea-force was to sail from Boston and attack
Quebec at the same time. This for a while promised better.</p>

<p>During the previous year the Boston merchants had lost ships and cargoes
by French cruisers, which harbored at Port Royal.<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> Another chapter
tells the story of the reprisals which the aroused New Englanders made,
and how Sir William Phips had returned with captives and booty to Boston,
just after the Massachusetts Government had begun to make preparations
to carry out their part of the campaign as planned in New York. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
is no test of soldiership like success, and the adventitious results of the
Port Royal expedition stood with the over-confident and unthinking for
much more than they signified, and Phips of course was put in command
of the new Armada. Money was borrowed, for recurrent frontier wars
had drained the colonial treasuries. England was appealed to; but she
refused even to contribute munitions of war. So with a bluff and coarse
adventurer for a general, with a Cape Cod militia-man in John Walley as
his lieutenant, with a motley force of twenty-two hundred men crowded
in thirty-two extemporized war-ships, and with a scant supply of ammunition,
the fleet left Boston Harbor in August, 1690.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Frontenac at Quebec had, during the winter, been constructing
palisades in front of the inland side of the upper town, and leaving the
work to go on, had gone up in the early summer to Montreal, to be elated
by the arrival of a large fleet of canoes bringing furs from the upper lakes.
All this indicated to Frontenac that his policy of reclaiming to the French
interest the tribes about Michillimackinac was working successfully, and he
rejoiced. While here, however, he got news of Winthrop’s force coming
down Lake Champlain. It turned out that the English did nothing more
than to frighten him a little by the sudden onset of a scouting party under
John Schuyler, which fell upon the settlement at La Prairie, and then
vanished.</p>

<p>Suddenly again word came of a rumor of a fleet having sailed from
Boston to attack Quebec. Frontenac made haste to return to that town,
and was met on the way by more definite intelligence of the New England
fleet having been seen in the river. When he reached Quebec, not a hostile
sail was in sight. He was in time, and his messengers were already
summoning assistance from all distant posts.</p>

<p>In coming up the river, Phips had captured two vessels, so that the
fleet which two or three days after Frontenac’s arrival slowly emerged into
the basin of Quebec counted thirty-four vessels to the anxious eyes of the
French. Phips’s prisoners had told him that there were not two hundred
men in the works; Frontenac knew that his reinforcements had already
made his garrison about twenty-seven hundred men.</p>

<p>Phips promptly sent a summons to surrender. His messenger was blindfolded
and tumbled about over the barricades, to impress him with the preparations
of defence. Frontenac disdained to take the offered hour for
consideration, and sent back his refusal at once. Phips dallied with councils
of war till he heard the acclamations with which the Governor of Montreal
was received, when he brought several hundred additional men to
the garrison. Walley was at last landed with a force of twelve or thirteen
hundred, who experienced some fighting, which they conducted courageously
enough, but without result, and suffered much from the inclemency
of the weather. Without waiting for the land troops to reach a position
for assaulting the town, Phips moved up his ships, and began a bombardment,
wholly ineffectual, and drew a return which damaged him so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
considerably, that, after renewing it the following day, he finally drew off.
There was another delay in rescuing Walley and his men, who were at last
re-embarked under cover of the night. The fleet now fell down the river,
stopped to repair, and then made their way back to Boston, straggling
along for several months, some of the vessels never reaching home at all.
The miseries of mortification and paper money were all that New England
had to show for her bravado.<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a></p>

<p>To Frontenac the success of his defence was a temporary relief, so far
as the English were concerned, though the New England cruisers continued
to intercept his supplies in the Gulf. But the Iroquois wolves began to
prowl again. Taunted by their savage allies for their inertness, the English
and Dutch of Albany once more raided towards Montreal, under Peter
Schuyler, and, inflicting more damage than they received, successfully broke
through an ambuscading force on their retreat. All this irritated Frontenac.
He prayed his King for help to destroy New York and Boston; and when
a false report reached him that ten thousand “Bastonnais” had sailed to
wreak their revenge for Phips’s failure, he set vigorously to work strengthening
the vulnerable points of his colony. He varied his activity with
continued expeditions against the Iroquois, whether strolling or at home,
striking particularly against the Mohawk towns; and he protected a great
fleet of canoes which in the troublous times had been kept back in the
upper country, and now brought credit and hope to the lower settlements
in an ample supply of furs.</p>

<p>But during all this turmoil with public foes, Frontenac was having his old
troubles over again with the Bishop and the Intendant. Outward courtesy
and secret dislike characterized their intercourse, and discord went in the
train of the Bishop as he made his pastoral tours among a people bound in
honor and reverence to the Governor.</p>

<p>The reader must turn to another page<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a> for the struggle with the “Bastonnais”
which Frontenac was watching meanwhile in Acadia; but this did
not divert his attention from the grand castigation which at last he was
planning for the Iroquois. He had succeeded, in 1694, in inducing them
to meet him in general council at Quebec, and had framed the conditions
of a truce; but the English at Albany intrigued to prevent the fulfilment,
and war was again imminent. Both sides were endeavoring to secure the
alliance of the tribes of the upper lakes.<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> These wavered, and Frontenac
saw the peril and the remedy. His recourse was to attack the Iroquois in
their villages at once, and conquer on the Mohawk the peace he needed
at Michillimackinac. It was Frontenac’s last campaign. In July, 1696, he
left Montreal with twenty-two hundred men. He went by way of Fort
Frontenac, crossed Lake Ontario, landed at Oswego, and struggled up its
stream, and at last set sails to his canoes on Lake Onondaga. Then his
force marched again, and Frontenac, enfeebled by his years, was borne
along in an arm-chair. Eight or nine miles and a day’s work brought
them to the Onondagas’ village; but its inhabitants had burned it and
fled. Vaudreuil was sent with a detachment, which destroyed the town of
the Oneidas. After committing all the devastation of crops that he could,
in hopes that famine would help him, Frontenac began his homeward march
before the English at Albany were aroused at all. The effect was what
Frontenac wished. The Iroquois ceased their negotiations with the western
tribes, and sued for peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile the crowns and diplomats of England and France had concluded
the Peace of Ryswick in 1697. Frontenac got word of it from New
York as early as February of 1698, and a confirmation from Louis in July.
There were still some parries of diplomacy between the old French soldier
and the English governor at New York, the Earl of Bellomont, each trying
to maintain the show of a paramount authority over the Five Nations.
But Frontenac was not destined to see the end. In November he sickened.
His adversary, Champigny, mollified at the sight, became reconciled to him,
and soothed his last hours. On the twenty-eighth he died, in the seventy-eighth
year of his age, and New France sincerely mourned her most distinguished
hero.</p>

<h3><a name="c356" id="c356"></a>CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap08">A LARGE portion of the manuscript sources of this chapter may be found in the
invaluable collection of papers relating to New France in the Archives of the Marine
and Colonies, the Archives Nationales, and the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris; and in
the office of the Provincial Registrar at Quebec. The archives of New York, Massachusetts,
and Canada have made extensive transcripts from these documents, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>Correspondance Officiele</i>, first series, vols. i.-v. There are transcripts from the
Paris documents copied in France for the State of New York, and translations of them
all are in the ninth and tenth volumes of the <i>Documents relating to the Colonial History
of the State of New York</i>.<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a></p>

<p>2. <i>Correspondance Officiele</i>, second series, vols. ii., iv.-viii. These papers exist in
manuscript, and have not been translated into English. Copies are in the Library of Parliament,
Ottawa, and in the Archives Office of the Quebec Government.</p>

<p>3. A collection of papers made by an agent of Massachusetts at Paris, relating chiefly
to Acadian matters, contains also a good deal about Frontenac. They were copied
afterward in Boston on an order from the Quebec Government, and are in the keeping
of the Registrar at Quebec. The Quebec administration intends publishing these
papers.<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> [They have since been published.]</p>

<p>The original Register and Proceedings of Council, in several volumes, remain in very
fair condition in the archives of the Quebec Government. The first, a folio bound in
calf and indexed, bears two titles, the first of which is, <i>Registre des Insinuations du
Conseil Supérieur de 1663 à 1682</i>, ninety-six pages. It begins with the King’s edict creating
the Superior Council, dated April 1, 1663, and ends with the “Procès Verbal” of
the Superior Council concerning the <i>Redaction</i> of the <i>Code Civil</i>, or ordinance of Louis,
April 14, 1667.</p>

<p>The second title is, <i>Jugements et Délibérations du Conseil Souverain de la Nouvelle
France, 1663 à 1676</i>, two hundred and eighty-one pages. It begins with an <i>arrêt</i> of the
Superior Council ordering the registration of the King’s edict of April 1, 1663, creating
the Superior Council for New France, to be held at Quebec; and ends with an interlocutory
judgment, dated Dec. 19, 1676, upon a petition of François Noir Roland, complaining
of his curate for refusing him absolution. This book, or register, is authenticated by the
certificate of the Governor, Comte de Frontenac, on the first page, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Le Présent Régîstre du Conseil Souverain contenant trois cens soixante et seize feuillets a
été ce jour paraphé <i>ne varietur</i> par premier et dernier, par nous Louis de Buade de Frontenac
Chevallier Comte de Palluau, Conseiller du Roy en ses Conseils, Gouverneur et Intendant Général
pour sa Majesté, en la Nouvelle France, Québec le quinzième Janvier Mille six cents soixante et
quinze.”</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct">“<span class="smcap">Frontenac.</span>”</p>

<p class="p1">The entries in general throughout this end of the book are authenticated by the Governor,
Bishop, Intendant, councillors, or Clerk of the Council; and the last, or two hundred
and eighty-first leaf, is signed by Duchesneau, Intendant, and by Dupont, Member of the
Council. Its general contents consist of a variety of orders, regulations, ordinances, judgments,
civil and criminal, of the Superior Council, licitation, and adjudications of Crown
estates, representations to the King and his ministers upon various subjects. There are
four following volumes of this register in the archives at Quebec bearing the dates 1677 to
1680, 1681, 1681 to 1687, and 1688 to 1693, respectively. Each of these contains interesting
details of Council proceedings during the first administration of Frontenac, the time of
La Barre and Denonville, and during Frontenac’s second term.</p>

<p>The <i>Édits et Ordonnances</i>, vol. iii., contain copies of the commissions of Frontenac,
La Barre, and Denonville.</p>

<p>For particulars concerning the youth of Frontenac, his family and marriage, see Parkman’s
Appendix, where, among other sources, are named the journal of Jean Héroard,
physician to the court, part of which is cited in <i>Le Correspondant</i> of Paris for 1873;
Pinard, <i>Chronologie Historique-Militaire</i>; <i>Les Mémoires de Sully</i>; <i>Table de la Gazette
de France</i>; <i>Mémoires de Philippe Hurault</i> (in Petitot); Jal, <i>Dictionnaire Critique</i>, <i>Biographique,
et d’Histoire</i>, article, “Frontenac;” <i>Historiettes de Tallemant des Réaux, ix.</i>
(ed. Monmerqué); <i>Mémoires de Mademoiselle de Montpensier</i>, vols. i.-iii.; and <i>Mémoires
du Duc de Saint-Simon</i>.<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a></p>

<p>At Frontenac’s death we have an <i>Oraison funèbre du Comte de Frontenac, par le Père
Olivier Goyer</i>, preached from the text: “In multitudine videbor bonus et in bello fortis.”
A copy of this eulogy, containing a running commentary on its sentiments strongly
adverse to the views of the orator, is preserved in the Seminary of Quebec. These comments,
selections from which will be found in Parkman’s <i>Count Frontenac and New
France under Louis XIV.</i>, pp. 431-434, are, the Abbé Casgrain informs me, from the
caustic pen of the Abbé Charles Glandelet, who came to Canada in 1675, and labored half
a century in the Seminary. He was first theologian, superior, and confessor of the Ursulines,
and died at Three Rivers at the advanced age of eighty years.</p>

<p>In considering the early printed books pertaining to our subject, we find them copious;
but unfortunately we can scarcely account many of them trustworthy historical authorities,
since prejudice and partisanship characterize them for the most part. The contests of the
period greatly developed antagonisms, and it was not easy at the time to resist their influences.
When we collate the writings of these contemporaries, we find a great lack of
unity and sympathy, and this often extends to matters of trifling import. While thus in
many ways these books fail of becoming satisfactory chronicles, as expressions of current
partisan feeling they often throw great light on all transactions; and it is fortunate that
in their antagonisms they give rival sentiments and opposing narratives, from which the
careful student, with the help of official and other contemporary documents, may in the
main satisfy his mind. Foremost among these early narratives is the <i>Premier Établissement
de la Foy dans la Nouvelle France</i> of the Père Le Clercq: of this, however, as well
as of the works of Hennepin and La Hontan, Tonti, and Marquette, an examination is
made in another chapter.<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a></p>

<p>Of the more general early narratives, we must give a prominent place to a book which
ranks as a respectable authority, and is frequently quoted,&mdash;Bacqueville de la Potherie’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
<i>Histoire de l’Amérique Septentrionale depuis 1534 jusqu’à 1701</i>, Paris, 1722, four volumes.
It is particularly useful in studying the relations of Frontenac and Callières, but as a contribution
upon the condition of the Indians at that time it has its chief value.<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Histoire du Canada</i> of the Abbé Belmont, superior of the Seminary of Montreal
during 1713 and 1724, is a short history of affairs from 1608 to 1700. The Literary and
Historical Society of Quebec printed, about 1840, in their <i>Collection de Mémoires</i>, a small
edition of the work from a manuscript copy in the Bibliothèque Nationale of Paris. It is
very scarce, and copies are held at high prices, but the Society intend reissuing it shortly.
Its general accuracy has not been questioned, and the views expressed are evidently the
outcome of careful consideration.</p>

<p>The general history of the administrations of Frontenac, De la Barre, and Denonville
is exhaustively treated by Father Francis-Xavier de Charlevoix; and the first place in
time and importance among the contributions to the general history of Canada, of a date
earlier than the present century, must be given to this Jesuit’s <i>Histoire et Description
Générale de la Nouvelle France, avec le Journal Historique d’un Voyage fait par l’Ordre
du Roi dans l’Amérique Septentrionale</i>, which was issued at Paris in 1744.<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a> Shea says:
“Access to State papers and the archives of the religious order to which he belonged,
experience and skill as a practised writer, a clear head and an ability to analyze, arrange,
and describe, fitted him for his work.” Parkman, whose studies have made him a close
observer of Charlevoix’s methods, speaks of his “usual carelessness.”</p>

<p>Charlevoix arrived in Canada in September, 1720, on an expedition to inspect the
missions of Canada. His purpose took him throughout the limits of New France and
Louisiana, and by the Illinois and the Mississippi to the Gulf. His work is commensurate
with his opportunities; his faults and errors were those of his order; and his religious
training inclined him to give perhaps undue prominence to the ecclesiastical side of his
subject; and though the character of Frontenac suffers but little at his hands, some of the
prejudice which Charlevoix bestows upon the Recollects necessarily colors his judgment
in matters where the Governor came in contact with the Jesuits.</p>

<p>The Abbé La Tour, not a very trustworthy authority, wrote <i>Mémoires sur la Vie de
M. de Laval, premier Évêque de Québec</i> in 1761,&mdash;a small book which is worth looking
into, though not with the object of accepting all its statements. Frontenac is bitterly
attacked, his faults magnified, and many serious charges are preferred against him. But
one volume, however, was published,&mdash;a thin book of a few pages, bearing the imprint
of Jean Frederick Motiens, Cologne, 1761. The second volume was never printed. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
copy of vol. i. which the Abbé Vemey possessed has this note in the latter’s handwriting:
“L’Abbé de la Tour de Montauban, author of this Life, of which the first volume only has
been published, promised me a manuscript copy of the second volume; but he did not
keep his word. Owing to the unfair manner in which Bishop St. Vallier was treated in
the second volume, his family objected to its publication.” The first volume ends with
the year 1694. A second edition was published at Paris in 1762.<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a></p>

<p>A useful work, which should not be lost sight of in the consideration of this period, is
<i>L’Histoire de l’Hôtel Dieu de Québec, de 1639 à 1716</i>, by the reverend mother, Françoise
Juchereau de St. Ignace, printed in Paris in 1751. It is rich in facts and incidents, and
especially valuable as an authority on the missionary activity of the time, and on the
attempt made by the clergy to evangelize the savages. A supplementary work, prepared
with great care and thoroughness from original documents, and bearing the same title, has
been written by the Abbé H. R. Casgrain. It is brought down to 1840, and was published
at Quebec in 1878. The Abbé is one of the most industrious of the French-Canadian
writers, and his book is full of interesting details and notes.<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a></p>

<p>In the third series of <i>Historical Documents</i> published under the auspices of the
Literary and Historical Society of Quebec in 1871, is a paper entitled “Recueil de ce qui
s’est passé en Canada au sujet de la guerre, tant des Anglais que des Iroquois, depuis
l’année 1682.” It contains a good account of the Lachine massacre, the truthfulness
of which may be accepted. The author accompanied Subercase to the scene.<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a></p>

<p>In a collection entitled, <i>Bibliotheca Americana: Collection d’ouvrages inédits ou rares
sur l’Amérique</i>, with the imprint of Leipsic and Paris, appeared the <i>Mémoire sur les
Mœurs, Coustumes, et Réligions des Sauvages de l’Amérique Septentrionale, par Nicolas
Perrot, publié pour la première fois par le R. P. Tailhan, de la Compagnie de Jésus</i>,
1864. Considerable importance is attached to this memoir by Charlevoix, La Potherie,
Ferland, and others, who frequently quote it in their narratives. Harrisse (no. 833) says
that this work seems to have been written day by day from 1665 to the death of Perrot,
who was an eye-witness of events under the administration of De la Barre, Denonville,
and Frontenac. Colden gives a part of the narrative in his <i>History of the Five Indian
Nations</i>, London, 1747.<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a></p>

<p>It remains to characterize the chief general works of our own time, which indicate the
great interest with which modern research has invested the story of New France. The
French-Canadians generally accept François-Xavier Garneau as their national historian,
and his <i>Histoire du Canada</i> well entitles him to that consideration. He began writing
his history in 1840, and published the first volume in Quebec in 1845, the second in
1846, and the third, treating of events down to 1792, in 1848. A new edition, revised and
corrected, and brought down to 1840, appeared at Montreal from Lovell’s press, in 1852,
and a third edition at Quebec in 1859.<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> In 1882 the fourth edition, edited by his son,<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a>
was issued at Montreal by Beauchemin &amp; Valois. It is enriched by many valuable
notes, and has a recognized place as a work of conspicuous merit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span></p>

<p>The ecclesiastical history of Canada is particularly illustrated by the Abbé J. B. A. Ferland
in his <i>Cours d’Histoire du Canada</i>, 1534-1759, Quebec, 1861 and 1865, two volumes.
The author died while the second volume was passing through the press, and the completing
of the publication devolved upon the Abbé Laverdière, one of the ablest scholars in the
Canadian priesthood. Ferland had access to many documents of great interest, and his
work shows judgment and a skilful handling of the rich store of materials within his reach.<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Histoire de la Colonie Française en Canada</i>, with maps, by the Abbé Faillon,
a Sulpitian priest of very great ability, was projected on an extensive plan. The author
visited Canada on three separate occasions, spending several years in the country, and
made the most of his opportunities in gathering his material, not only there, but from the
archives of the Propaganda at Rome and from the public offices in Paris. The result was
a work of high value; but it must be read with a full perception of the author’s intention
to rear a monument to commemorate the labors and trials of the Sulpitians of Montreal.</p>

<p>Parkman<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a> thus speaks of him: “In all that relates to Montreal I cannot be sufficiently
grateful to the Abbé Faillon, the indefatigable, patient, conscientious chronicler
of its early history; an ardent and prejudiced Sulpitian; a priest who three centuries
ago would have passed for credulous, and withal a kind-hearted and estimable man.”</p>

<p>Three volumes only appeared, the first two in 1865, and the third in 1866. The latter
deals with events covered by a small portion of the period discussed in this chapter. M.
Faillon’s death at Paris in 1871 prevented further publication; but he has left in manuscript
enough prepared material to complete the work as far as the conquest of 1759-1760.
The book was published anonymously, according to the custom of the Congregation of
St. Sulpice.<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a></p>

<p>It is, however, to an American of Puritan stock that the story we are illustrating owes,
for the English reader certainly, its most conspicuous recital. Two volumes of Francis
Parkman’s series of <i>France and England in North America</i> concern more especially the
period covered by the administrations of Frontenac, De la Barre, and Denonville; these
are his <i>Frontenac, and New France under Louis XIV.</i> (Boston, 1877), and his <i>La Salle,
and the Discovery of the Great West</i> (Boston, 1879); but the consideration of the last of
these belongs more particularly to another chapter. Of Parkman as an historian there
has been a wide recognition of a learning that has neglected no resource; a research
which has proved fortunate in its results; a judgment which, though Protestant, is fair
and liberal;<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a> a critical perception, which in the conflict of testimony keeps him accurate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
and luminous; and a style which has given his narrative the fascinations of a
romance.</p>

<p>John Dennis wrote a tragedy,&mdash;<i>Liberty Asserted</i>,&mdash;which was acted in London in
1704, in which Frontenac was made a character, together with an English governor
and Iroquois chief. Betterton acted in it. A romantic picture of the period is furnished
in an amusing novel by M. Joseph Marmette, formerly of Quebec, but now of Paris,
entitled <i>François de Bienville</i>. Frontenac figures as one of the principal characters in
the story. Frontenac’s expeditions against the Iroquois were made the subject of a
poem by Alfred B. Street,&mdash;<i>Frontenac: or, the Atotarho of the Iroquois</i>. London and
New York, 1849.</p>

<p>M. T. P. Bedard, of the Archives department, has a paper in the <i>Annuaire de l’Institut
Canadien</i>, nos. 7 and 8, 1880, 1881, which discusses the first and second administrations of
the Count, and sheds some light on the social and political aspects of the country between
1672 and 1698, the year in which Frontenac died.</p>

of Frontenac and the <i>Relation</i> of Monseignat

<p>The copy of Phips’s
summons sent to Paris by Frontenac is indorsed
by him to the effect that he retained the original.
The <i>Mercure de France</i> also issued an “Extraordinaire,”
with an account (Harrisse, no. 166,)
and another brief <i>Relation de la levée du siége de
Québec</i> (Harrisse, no. 167) was printed at Tours.
La Hontan, Le Clercq, La Potherie, and Juchereau
(<i>L’Hôtel Dieu</i>), give other accounts contemporary,
or nearly so, and their testimony has
been availed of by Charlevoix (cf. Shea’s ed., iv.
169) and the later writers, like Garneau.</p>

<p>On the English side, besides a contemporary
bulletin issued in the <i>Publick Occurrences</i>, Boston,
Sept. 25, 1690 (given in <i>Hist. Mag.</i>, August,
1857), two participators in the expedition left
narratives,&mdash;one of which by John Walley is
printed in Hutchinson’s <i>Massachusetts</i>, i. app.
no. xxi., which concerns chiefly the land forces;
and the other was by the officer second in command
of the militia, and is entitled, <i>An account
of the late action of the New Englanders, under
the command of Sir William Phips, against the
French at Canada, sent in a letter from Maj.
Thomas Savage, of Boston, in New England</i> (<i>who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>

Savage, in London</i>. London, 1691. This quarto
tract is in Harvard College Library; it was reprinted
in the <i>Mass. Hist.

<p>In the same
<i>Collections</i>, third series, i.
101, is the diary of Captain Sylvanus Davis, who
was at the time a captive in Quebec; cf. also
Johnston’s <i>Bremen, Bristol, and Pemaquid</i>. An
original journal of the expedition is said to have
been intrusted to Admiral Walker at the time of
his venture in 1711, and to have been lost in one
of his ships (Walker’s <i>Journal</i>, p. 87). Phips’s
side of the story is doubtless told amid the high
laudation of Cotton Mather’s <i>Life of Phips</i>; some
light is thrown upon the times in Dummer’s <i>Defence
of the Colonies</i>; and various tokens of the
preparations for the expedition are preserved in
the <i>Hinckley Papers</i>, vol. iii, in the Prince Library.</p>

<p>Somewhat later we have the story in some of its
aspects in Colden’s <i>Five Nations</i>; later still, in
Hutchinson’s <i>Massachusetts Bay</i>, vol. i.; again,
in part, in Belknap’s <i>New Hampshire</i>; while
the chief modern writers who have preceded
Parkman, on the English
side, have been Palfrey’s
<i>New England</i>, iv.

<p>Of the supporting
Winthrop expedition from Albany, we have the
French accounts in La Potherie (iii. 126), and in
the <i>New York Colonial Documents</i>, ix. 513. The
recently published <i>Winthrop
Papers</i> (iv. 303-324)
throw considerable light
through the letters of Fitz-John Winthrop on
the preparations which were made; and they
give also his reasons for the expedition’s
failure, and through his Journal, with which
the one printed in the <i>New York Colonial
Documents</i>, iv. 193, may be compared. Parkman’s
<i>Frontenac</i> (p. 257) and Shea’s <i>Charlevoix</i>
(iv. 145) note the authorities; and the
<i>New York Colonial Documents</i> (iii. 727, 752)
and <i>Doc. Hist. N. Y.</i> (ii. 266, 288) yield other
light than that already mentioned. The Journal
of Schuyler’s raid to La Prairie is given
in the <i>Doc. Hist. N. Y.</i>, ii. 285, and in the publications
of the New Jersey Historical Society,
vol. i.</p>

<p>Concerning the minor episodes of this
second term of Frontenac’s government,
both Parkman and Shea indicate the essential
authorities. On the destruction of Schenectady,
the letter of Monseignat and other papers
in the <i>Doc. Hist. of New York</i>, vol. i. 297, etc.
(where authorities are cited), and a letter of
Schuyler and his associates in the Massachusetts
Archives, printed in the <i>Andros Tracts</i>, are of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
the first importance. Cf. also M. Van Rennsselaer’s
paper in <i>N. Y. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, 1846, p. 101,
and the same Society’s <i>Fund Publications</i>, ii. 165;
a letter from Governor Bradstreet, in the <i>N. E.
Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>, ii. 150; and the contributions
in Munsell’s <i>Albany</i>. French accounts are
in <i>Le Clercq</i> (Shea’s edition, ii.
292); <i>Potherie</i>, ii. 68; <i>N. Y. Col.
Docs.</i>, ix. 466; and English accounts
in Smith’s <i>New York</i>, p.

<p>On Schuyler’s raid by way of
Lake Champlain in 1691, the French side is still
to be gathered from La Potherie, with help from
Belmont, <i>Histoire du Canada</i>, and from the <i>Relation
of 1682-1712</i>, and from the despatches of
Frontenac and Champigny. Schuyler’s own
Journal and other documents, French and English,
are in the <i>N. Y. Colonial Documents</i>, vol.
iii.; Parkman (p. 294) examines the question of
the number of the forces engaged, and Shea,
<i>Charlevoix</i>, iv. 202, gives references.</p>

<div class="floatleft">

</div>

<p>On the expedition against the Mohawks, led
by Mantet, Courtemanche, and La Noue, we
have more various accounts. Parkman gives a
graphic recital, and his notes show he has used all
the sources. The French authorities, besides
the letter of Callières to the home government,
are the <i>Relation de ce qui s’est passé de plus remarquable
en Canada</i>, 1692-93; the <i>Relation de
ce qui s’est passé en Canada au sujet de la Guerre</i>,
1682-1712; while citations of original journals,
etc., are in Faillon’s <i>Vie de Mdle. Le Ber</i>, and
of course we have La Potherie (iii. 169) and
Belmont. The <i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, vol. ix., contain
important material, including a “Narrative
of Military Operations in Canada;” and
Major Peter Schuyler’s report is in vol. iv. of
the same collection. Colden, in his <i>Five Nations</i>,
p. 142, wrote while the actors were still living.
There was a tract on the expedition issued
in London the same year, which is of such
rarity that the copy in the Carter-Brown Library
(<i>Catalogue</i>, vol. ii. no. 1,446, with fac-simile of
title; also Harrisse, no. 171) is the only one
known to me, and from it Sabin, in 1868, reprinted
it. It is entitled, <i>A Journal of the late
actions of the French in Canada, with the
manner of their being repulsed, by his Excellency
Benjamin Fletcher, Governor of New
York</i>, etc. <i>By Coll. Nicholas Reyard</i> [should
be Beyard] <i>and Lieutenant-Coll. Charles Lodowick.</i></p>

<p>On Frontenac’s last raid,&mdash;the attack upon
the Onondagas, in 1696,&mdash;we must naturally
find our chief information from the French, for
the English at Albany
were not ready
to advance till the
French had done
their work and had
gone. Frontenac
and Callières each
despatched accounts
to Paris;
and besides the
<i>Relation</i>, 1682-1712,
already
referred to, we
have the <i>Relation
de ce qui s’est
passé en Canada</i>,&mdash;a
manuscript preserved
in the library
of the Literary
and Historical Society
of Quebec
(see <i>Parliamentary
Library Catalogue</i>,
1858, p. 1613); the
<i>Relation</i>, 1696,
which Shea has
printed, and of
course the accounts
in La Potherie, iii.
270, and Charlevoix (Shea adds references in
his edition, vol. v.), and the papers in the <i>Doc.
Hist. of N. Y.</i>, i. 323, and the <i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>
iv. 342. Parkman’s narrative (<i>Frontenac</i>, chap.
xix.) is clearly put and exemplified.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>B.</b> <span class="smcap">General Documentary Sources Of
Canadian History.</span>&mdash;Harrisse prefaces his
<i>Notes pour servir à l’histoire, à la bibliographie
et à la cartographie de la Nouvelle France et des
pays adjacents</i>, 1545-1700, Paris, 1872, with an
account of the sources of early Canadian history,
and of the repositories of documentary
material in Paris, etc. He states that the
French Government refused access to their archives
to an agent of the Historical Society of
Quebec in 1835, and that a similar refusal was
made in 1838; but that in 1842 General Cass,
then United States Minister, succeeded, in behalf
of the State of Michigan, in securing about forty
cartons for publication; and ten years later the
Parliament at Quebec obtained copies of documents,
which now (1872) form a series of thirty-six
folios,&mdash;not embracing, however, the papers
of the early discovery, which were withheld.</p>

<p>Louis P. Turcotte, in his address on <i>Les
Archives du Canada</i> (Quebec, 1877), says that
the first inventory of the public archives of
Canada was published in 1791; that it shows
the subsequent loss of important documents;
that the first steps were taken to procure copies
from the European archives in 1835, which
were not successful at the time; and that the
better results made by the State of New York
(1841-1844) were accordingly availed of. In
1845 the Canadian agent, M. Papineau, secured
other copies in France; and in 1851-1852 M.
Faribault added twenty-four volumes of transcripts
to the collection, now in the library at
Ottawa; and sixteen volumes have been added
since. M. Turcotte pays a tribute, for his zeal
and industry in preserving early Canadian records,
to M. Jacques Viger, whose efforts have
been since supplemented by the labors of l’Abbé
Verreau, who has formed a large library of copies
of manuscripts and printed books. M. Verreau
was in 1873 sent by the Canadian Government
to Europe to make additional collections.</p>

<p>The <i>Catalogue</i> of the Library of the Canadian
Parliament, made by Gérin-Lajoie, and published
in 1858, gives (p. 1448) an account of the manuscript
collections at that time in the possession
of the Canadian Government at Toronto, and
now transferred to Ottawa, and divides them
thus:—</p>

<p><i>First series.</i>&mdash;Copies of copies made by Brodhead
for the State of New York, from the archives
at Paris, seventeen volumes, with six
additional volumes, drawn at second hand in the
same way from the Colonial Office in London.
These copies were made before the Brodhead
collection was printed. Kirke, in his <i>First English
Conquest of Canada</i>, London, 1871, says:
“The papers in the Record Office [London]
relating to Canada, Acadia, or Nova Scotia, and
Newfoundland are numerous and continuous
from 1621 to 1660, with the exception of the
period from 1640 to 1649, during which years
we find no papers.”</p>

<p><i>Second series.</i>&mdash;Copies obtained in Paris by
Faribault, and made under Margry’s direction;
twelve volumes, giving the official correspondence
of the governors, 1637-1727. These are
enumerated in the <i>Catalogue</i>.</p>

<p><i>Third series.</i>&mdash;Copies of official correspondence
relative to Canada, 1654-1731; twelve
volumes, likewise arranged by Margry, and also
enumerated in the <i>Catalogue</i>.</p>

<p><i>Fourth series.</i>&mdash;A transcript of Franquet’s
“Voyages et mémoires sur le Canada, 1752-53,”
and other documents mentioned in the <i>Catalogue</i>.</p>

<p><i>Fifth series.</i>&mdash;Maps, copied by Morin, and
enumerated on pp. 1614-21 of the <i>Catalogue</i>.</p>

<p>Cf. <i>Collection de Mémoires et de Relations
sur l’histoire ancienne du Canada, d’après des
manuscrits récemment obtenus des archives et bureaux
publics en France</i>, Quebec, 1840; and the
Transactions of the Literary and Historical Society
of Quebec, 1870-71, and 1871-72. The
<i>Collection</i> contains Belmont and the Report attributed
to Talon. Cf. <i>Magazine of American
History</i>, iii. 458, in the Quebec Society.</p>

<p>The <i>Lettres, instructions et mémoires de Colbert,
publiés par Clément</i>, Paris, 1865, vol. iii.,
second part, contain
various important papers,&mdash;like
the instructions
as intendant
of Talon, March
27, 1665; of De Bouteroue, April 5, 1668; Duchesneau,
May 30, 1675; those to Gaudais in
1663, and to Courcelles in 1669: besides letters
to Frontenac, April 7, 1672; June 13, 1673; May
17, 1674; April 22, 1675; May 10, 1677; March
21, 1678; Dec. 4, 1679; April 30, 1681 (pp. 533,
557, 574, 585, 594, 622, 631, 641, 644): others to
Talon, Feb. 11, 1671; June 4, 1672 (pp. 511,
539); to Duchesneau, April 15, 1676; April 28,
1677; May 1, 1677; May 15 and 24, 1678; April
30, 1679 (pp. 605, 614, 619, 632, 635, 638); with
one to l’Évêque de Petrée, May 15, 1669 (p. 451).
Margry (i. 247) gives some of the correspondence
of Frontenac and Colbert, 1672-1674,
relative to the pushing of Recollect missionaries
farther west; and in Clément’s <i>Histoire de
Colbert</i>, Paris, 1874, vol. i. last chapter, there is
an exposition of Colbert’s colonial policy.</p>

<p>Mr. Ben: Perley Poore was appointed by the
Governor of Massachusetts, in May, 1845, to
select and transcribe such documents in the
French archives as he might find to bear upon
the early history of Massachusetts and the relations
of New England with New France. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
report to the Governor, Dec. 28, 1847, accompanied
by letters from John G. Palfrey and Jared
Sparks, telling the story of his work, constitutes
<i>Senate Doc., no. 9</i> (1848), <i>Mass. Documents</i>. His
transcripts, covering papers from the discovery
to 1780, fill ten volumes in the Archives of the
State, and are accompanied by two volumes of
engraved maps. Mr. Poore, under the auspices
of the Massachusetts Historical Society, and
with the pledge of Colonel William P. Winchester
to assume the expense if necessary, had
already a year earlier begun his work. M.
Davezac was at that time <i>chef des archives</i> of
the Marine, and the confusion which Brodhead,
the agent of New York, had earlier found
among the papers had disappeared under the
care of the new custodian. From other departments
as well as from other public and from
private sources, Mr. Poore increased his collection,
and added to it water-color drawings and
engraved prints of an illustrative nature; but
unfortunately many of the documents cited are
given by title only, and the blank pages left to
be filled are still empty. It is these papers
which have been copied within a year or two for
the Government of the Province of Quebec.</p>

<p>The manuscript collections of Mr. Parkman
are very extensive, and are still in his house;
the more important of his maps, however, have
been transferred to the College Library at Cambridge,
and these have been sketched elsewhere
in the present volume. The Editor is under
great obligations to Mr. Parkman for unrestricted
access to his manuscripts. They consist of large
masses of miscellaneous transcripts, with a few
original papers, and so far as they come within
the period of the present volume, of the following
bound series:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. <i>Acadia</i>, in three volumes. These are
transcripts made by, or under the direction of,
Mr. Ben: Perley Poore, and in considerable part
supplement the collection made by Mr. Poore
for the State of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>II. <i>Correspondance officielle</i>, in five volumes,
coming down to 1670, being transcripts from
the French archives.</p>

<p>III. <i>Canada</i>, in eight volumes, covering 1670-1700,
being transcripts from the French archives,
and supplementing Brodhead’s <i>Colonial Documents
of New York</i>, vol. ix.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>C.</b> <span class="smcap">Bibliography.</span>&mdash;Harrisse’s <i>Notes</i>, etc.,
is the latest of the general bibliographies of the
history and cartography of New France; and
this with his <i>Cabot</i> constitutes a complete, or
nearly so, indication of the sources of Canadian
history previous to 1700. Charlevoix in
1743 prefixed to his <i>Nouvelle France</i> a list of
authorities as known to him, and characterized
them; and this is included in Shea’s translation.
Of the modern writers, Ferland and Faillon in
their introduction each make note of their predecessors.
The work of G. B. Faribault, <i>Catalogue
d’ouvrages sur l’histoire de l’Amérique, et en
particulier sur celle du Canada, avec des notes</i>,
Quebec, 1837, containing nine hundred and
ninety-six titles, besides maps, etc., has lost
whatever importance its abounding errors left
for it formerly. There is a biographical sketch
(1867) of Faribault in the Abbé Casgrain’s
<i>Œvres</i>, vol. ii. Cf. Morgan’s <i>Bibliotheca Canadensis</i>,
p. 118. H. J. Morgan’s <i>Bibliotheca Canadensis</i>,
Ottawa, 1867, includes the writers on
Canadian history who have published since
the conquest of 1759.</p>

<p>From this book and other sources the following
enumeration of the various general histories
of Canada, compendious as well as elaborate,
and including such as cover a long interval
in a general way, is taken:&mdash;</p>

<p>Excepting one volume of a projected <i>History
of Canada</i>, by George Heriot, published in London
in 1804, and which was an abridgment of
Charlevoix, the earliest of modern works is <i>The
History of Canada from its first Discovery to
1796</i>, by William Smith, published in Quebec in
1815. The author was a son of the historian of
New York.</p>

<p>There was published in Paris in 1821, in a
duodecimo of 512 pages, a sketchy compendium
by D. Dainville,&mdash;<i>Beautés de l’histoire du Canada,
ou époques remarquables, traits intéressans, mœurs,
usages, coutumes des habitants du Canada, tant indigènes
que colons, depuis sa découverte jusqu’à ce
jour</i>.</p>

<p>In 1837 Michael Bibaud published at Montreal
a <i>Histoire du Canada sous la domination
Française</i>. A second edition was published in
1845. In 1844 appeared his <i>Histoire du Canada
et des Canadiens sous la domination Anglaise</i>.
This author also published a <i>Bibliothèque Canadienne</i>,
a monthly magazine, which for several
years gathered and preserved considerable documentary
material.</p>

<p>Between 1845 and 1848 the work of Garneau,
mentioned in the preceding chapter, was printed,
which became the basis of Bell’s adaptation in
1866.</p>

<p>In 1851 a comprehensive compendium by
W. H. Smith,&mdash;<i>Canada</i> [West]: <i>Past, Present,
and Future</i>,&mdash;in two volumes, was published
at Toronto.</p>

<p>Brasseur de Bourbourg’s <i>Histoire du Canada;
de son Église et de ses missions</i>, published in Paris
in 1852, is characterized in the Note on the <i>Jesuit
Relations</i>, following chap. vi.</p>

<p>A popular <i>History of Canada from its first Discovery
to the Present Time</i>, by John MacMullen
was published at Brockville in 1855 and 1868.</p>

<p>L. Dussieux’s <i>Le Canada sous la domination
Française</i> was published at Paris in 1855, and a
new edition in 1862.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span></p>

<p>F. M. N. M. Bibaud’s <i>Les Institutions de l’histoire
du Canada</i> (to 1818), Montreal, 1855, is a
concise narrative.</p>

<p>Between 1861 and 1865, and in 1865-1866,
were published the works of Ferland and Faillon,
of which note is made in the preceding chapter.</p>

<p>John Boyd’s <i>Summary of Canadian History</i>
was issued at Toronto in 1860, and many editions
since.</p>

<p>In 1863 Boucher de la Bruère, fils, published
a brief survey,&mdash;<i>Le Canada sous la domination
Anglaise</i>.</p>

<p>Alexander Monro’s <i>History, Geography, and
Statistics of British North America</i> was published
at Montreal in 1864.</p>

<p>William Canniff’s <i>History of the Settlement of
Upper Canada, with special reference to the Bay
Quinté</i>, appeared at Toronto in 1869. This book
was undertaken under the auspices of the Historical

<p class="drop-cap04">THE general atlases at this time becoming
familiar to Europe were unfortunately
made up on a thrifty principle, little conducive
to keeping the public mind abreast of current
discovery,&mdash;so far as America, at least, was concerned,&mdash;and
very perplexing now to any one
studying the course of the cartographical development
of American geography. Dates were
sedulously erased with a deceitful purpose (which
is not yet gone into disuse) from plates thus
made to do service for many years, and united
with other dated maps, to convey an impression
of a like period of production.</p>

<p>Bestelli e Forlani’s <i>Tavole moderne di Geografia
de la maggior parte del mondo</i>, Roma, 1558-80,
with seventy-one large maps, including three
maps of the world, and three of America, is
reputed the best atlas which had been constructed
up to that date. Sets vary much in
their make-up.<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps the prototype of the modern atlas
can be best found in the <i>Theatrum orbis terrarum</i>
of Ortelius, issued in the first edition at
Antwerp in 1570, of which an account has been
given elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> His portrait is on a later page.</p>

<p>In 1597 appeared the earliest special atlas of
America in the <i>Descriptionis Ptolemaicæ Augmentum</i>
of Cornelius Wytfliet, which was reissued
the same year with its errata corrected.<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> It had
nineteen maps, which were also used in the
second edition, issued in 1598. A fac-simile of
the title of 1597 is given on the next page.<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a></p>

<p>Reference has been made elsewhere to the
conspicuous work of Gerard Mercator, which
was a sort of culmination of his geographical
views, in his great mappemonde of 1569.<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a> Then
after giving his attention to a closer study of
Ptolemy and to the publication of an edition of
the great Alexandrian geography, with a revision
of Agathodæmon’s charts, but without any attempt
to make them conform to the newer knowledge,
he set about the compilation of a modern
geographical <i>atlas</i> (applying
this word for
the first time to such
a collection, though
modern usage has
somewhat narrowed
the meaning as he applied
it); and he had
published two parts
of it, when he died,
in December, 1594,&mdash;the
second part having
appeared at Duisburg
in 1585, and
the third in 1590.
Shortly after his
death, a son, Rumold
Mercator, published
in 1595, at Dusseldorf,
part i., and prefixed
to it a Latin biography
of his father, by
Walter Ghymm,
which is the principal
source of our
knowledge of his career.<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a>
The son Rumold
died in 1600,
and in 1602, at the
expense of the estate,
the three parts of the
<i>Atlas</i> were united and
published together,
making what is properly
the earliest edition
of the so-called
<i>Mercator Atlas</i>. It
had one hundred and
eleven maps and a
Latin text. It is very
rare, for Raemdonck
says he has met with but two copies of it. Up
to this time it had contained no American maps.
A map of America, as one of the four quarters
of the globe, was called for in part iii.; but
Raemdonck (p. 257) says he has never seen a
copy of that part which has it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>

<p>Mercator’s maps were followed, however,
pretty closely in Mathias Quad’s or Quadus’s
<i>Geographisch Handtbuch</i>,<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> Cologne, 1600, which
contained a map of the world and another of
North America, with some other special American
maps; and such were also contained in the
Latin version called <i>Fasciculus geographicus</i>,
Cologne, 1608, etc.</p>

<p>In 1604 Mercator’s plates fell by purchase into
the possession of Jodocus Hondius,<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> of Amsterdam,
who got out a new edition in 1606,<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a> to which
he added fifty maps, including a few American

Montanus,<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> and the new maps were engraved by

<p>After the death of Jodocus Hondius, Feb. 16,
1611, Heinrich Hondius (b. 1580; d. 1644) and Johannes
Jannsonius (d. 1666) completed the <i>Atlas</i>;
and what is known as the fourth edition (1613)
contains portraits of Mercator and the elder
Hondius. In this there were ten American maps,
and for several editions subsequently there were
105 of Mercator’s maps and 51 of Hondius’.
Such seemingly was the make-up of the seventh
edition in 1619 (though called fourth on the
title); but there is much arbitrary mingling of
the maps observable in many copies of these
early editions.</p>

<p>The same Latin text and its translations
appeared in the several editions down to 1630,
when what is called sometimes the eleventh edition
appeared with 163 maps (105 by Mercator,
58 by Hondius); but I have noted copies with
184 maps, of which ten are American, and a
copy dated 1632, with 178 maps. Raemdonck
does not venture to enumerate all the Latin
editions of Hondius and Jannsonius; but he
mentions those of 1612, 1613, 1616, 1623, 1627,
1628, 1630, 1631.</p>

<p>In 1633 a marked change was made in the <i>Mercator-Hondius
Atlas</i>. There was a new Latin text,
and it was now called the <i>Atlas novus</i>, and made
two volumes, containing 238 newly engraved
maps (only 87 of Mercator’s remaining, while
Hondius added 151, including 10 new maps of
America). The French text was issued the same
year, but it added details not in the Latin, and
in the general description of America is quite
different.<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a> The German text also appeared in
1633; but it had&mdash;at least in the copy we have
noted&mdash;only 160 maps, and of these 6 were
American. The Dutch text is dated usually in
1634.</p>

<p>In 1635 the English text appeared with the
following title: <i>Historia Mundi; or, Mercator’s
Atlas.... Lately rectified in divers places, and
also beautified and enlarged with new mappes and
tables by the studious industry of Iudocus Hondy.
Englished by W. S.</i>, London;<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> and of this there
was a second edition in 1637. The only map
showing New France is a general one of America,
which is no improvement upon that of the
1613 edition.</p>

<p>The English market was also supplied with
another English version, published much more
sumptuously, in two large folios, at Amsterdam
in 1636, with the title, <i>Atlas; or, a Geographical
Description of the Regions ... of the World, represented
by New and Exact Maps. Translated by
Henry Hexham. Printed at Amsterdam by Henry
Hondius and John Johnson</i>.<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> The American
maps are in the second volume, where the map
of the two Americas is much like the world-map
in vol. i. There is no part of New France shown
in the special maps, except in that of “Nova Anglia,
Novum Belgium, et Virginia,” where lying
west of the Lac des Iroquois (Ontario) is a single
and larger “Grand lac.”</p>

<p>A still further enlargement of the Mercator-Hondius
<i>Atlas novus</i> took place in 1638, when
it appeared in three imperial folio volumes, with
318 maps, 17 of which are special maps of
America.<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> It was now more commonly known
as Jannson’s <i>Atlas</i>,&mdash;this publisher being a son-in-law
of Jodocus Hondius,&mdash;and it went on
increasing till it grew to eight volumes, to which
were added a volume “Orbis Maritimus” (1657),
a second on the ancient world, a celestial atlas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
for a third, and an “Atlas Contractus,” or <i>résumé</i>,
for the fourth; making twelve in all.<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a></p>

<p class="p2">At this time there was a rival in the <i>Atlas</i> of
Blaeu, of which the reader will find an account
in chapter ix. of the present volume, to be supplemented
by the present brief statement.</p>

<p>Willem Jannson Blaeu was born in 1571,
and died in 1638, and, with his sons Jean and
Cornelis, devoted himself with untiring assiduity
to his art. In 1647 the number of their maps
reached one hundred. In 1655 their <i>Atlas</i> had
reached six volumes, and contained 372 maps.
In this year (1655) the Blaeu establishment issued
separately the American map, <i>Americæ nova
Tabula</i>, with nine views of towns and representations
of native costumes, accompanied by four
pages of text. The Latin edition of 1662-63,
<i>Atlas major, sive cosmographia Blaviana</i>, had 586
maps, of which the collection in the <i>Carter-Brown
Catalogue</i> (ii. 900) shows 23 in vol. xi. to
belong to America.<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a></p>

<p>The Blaeu establishment was burned in 1672,
and most of the plates were lost. Those which
were saved passed into the hands of Frederic
de Witt, who put his name on them, and they
continued to be issued thus inscribed in the
<i>Blaeu Atlas</i> of 1685, etc.; and when De Witt’s
business fell to Covens and Mortier, the inscriptions
were again altered.<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a></p>

<p class="p2">A French atlas began a little later to attract
attention, and ultimately made the name of its
maker famous in cartographic annals. It was
begun in 1646 by Nicolas Sanson d’Abbeville,
who in 1647 was appointed Royal Geographer
of France, and held that office till his death.<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a>
The volume of his <i>Atlas</i>, containing fifteen American
maps, and entitled <i>L’Amérique, en plusieurs
Cartes nouvelles et exactes</i>, was published by the
author in Paris without date, but probably in
1656, though some copies are dated in 1657,
1658, and 1662.<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a></p>

<p>The elder Sanson, having been born in 1600,
died in 1667, leaving about four hundred plates to
his sons, who kept up the name,<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> and their stock
subsequently fell to Robert Vaugondy, who has
given a notice of the Sansons in his <i>Essai sur
l’Hist. de la Géog.</i>, as has Lenglet Dufresnoy in his
<i>Méthode pour étudier la Géographie</i>.<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a></p>

<p>A new Dutch atlas, that of N. Visscher, called
<i>Atlas minor, sive Geographia compendiosa</i>, appeared
at Amsterdam about 1670. It contained
twenty-six maps, and had three American maps;
but the number was increased in later editions.<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a>
In 1680 it appeared in two volumes with 195 maps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
10 of which were American, and plates by Jannson,
De Witt, and others, were included. It is
not easy to discriminate among various composite
atlases of this period, the chief cartographers
being made to contribute to various imprints.
Another <i>Atlas minor, novissimas Orbis Terrarum
Tabulas complectens</i>, is likewise of this date (1680),
and passes under the name of S. Wolfgang, with
maps by Blaeu, Visscher, De Witt, and others.
This usually contains nineteen American maps.
Other atlases have the name of Frederic de Witt,
who, as we have seen, got possession of some of
Blaeu’s plates. The first example of his imprint
appeared about 1675, at Amsterdam, with
a printed index calling for 102 maps. Another
edition (? 1680) is indexed for 160 plates,
contained in two volumes of maps, and a third
of charts.<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a> Another small German atlas, the
<i>Vorstellung der gantzen Welt</i>, of J. U. Muller, was
published at Ulm in 1692, which had eighteen
small American maps; and towards the close of
the century the <i>Atlas minor</i> of Allard obtained a
good popularity. The pre-eminent name of Delisle,
just becoming known, marked the opening
of a new era in cartography, which is beyond
the limits of the present volume.</p>

<p class="p2">Some notice should be given of another class
of atlases, the successors of the portolanos of
the sixteenth century, and the beginning of the
later science of hydrography. In these the Dutch
were conspicuous; and many of their subsequent
charts trace back to the larger <i>pascaart</i> of
the North Atlantic which Jacob Aertz Colom
published at Amsterdam about 1630.<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> Among
the earliest of the regular <i>Zee-Atlases</i> was that of
Theunis Jacobsz, published in Amsterdam about
1635, which has a chart showing the American
coast-line from Nova Francia to Virginia. Of
large importance in this direction was the <i>Arcano
del Mare</i> of Robert Dudley, issued at Florence
in 1646-1647, of which mention has been
made in other chapters in this and in the preceding
volume. Another of the Amsterdam Coloms&mdash;Arnold
Colom&mdash;published his <i>Zee-Atlas</i> about
1650, which contains six American coast-charts,
and sometimes appears with a Latin title, <i>Ora
maritima Orbis universi</i>, and is of interest in the
historical study of our American coast-lines,
improving as he does the preceding work of
Jacobsz. Later editions of Colom, dating the
charts, appeared in 1656 and 1663.<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> Of about
this same date (1654) is a <i>pascaart</i>, published
at Amsterdam, which seems to have been the
joint business project of Frederic de Witt, Anthony
and Theunis Jacobsz, and Gulielmus
Blaeu. The world-map in it is dated 1652, and
is doubly marked “C. J. Visscher” (Claes Jannson
Visscher) and “Autore N. J. Piscator”
(Nicolas Joanides), as the Latin equivalent of
the same person. It shows the Atlantic coast
from Labrador to Brazil. The first edition of
Hendrick Doncker’s <i>Zee-Atlas ofte Water-Waereld</i>
appeared at Amsterdam in 1659, and
is particularly useful for the American coasts.
New maps were added to it in the edition of
1666; but the <i>Nieuwe Groote vermeerderde Zee-Atlas</i>
of 1676, though still called Doncker’s, is
based on Colom, and has Colom’s six American
charts. Additional American and other charts
were added to the 1697 edition; while a set of
still larger charts constitute Doncker’s <i>Nieuw
Groot Zeekaert-boek</i> of 1712.<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Zee-Atlas</i> of Van Loon, with its forty-five
double charts, appeared in 1661.<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a> It is in parts
reproduced from Blaeu, De Laet, and Jannson.
Its numbers 46 and 47 show the coast from Newfoundland
southwards. P. Goos, in his <i>Lichtende
Colomme</i>, Amsterdam, 1657, had touched
the Arctic coasts of America; but in his <i>Zee-Atlas</i>
of 1666 he gave in excellent manner eleven
charts of the coasts of both Americas, out of the
forty-one charts in all. These were all repeated
in the edition of 1668-1669, and in the French
edition, <i>Atlas de la Mer</i>, 1673. Other Dutch
editions, with some changes, followed in 1675 and
1676. It was issued with an English text at
Amsterdam in 1670.</p>

<p>Frederic de Witt, who had earlier appended
to his <i>Atlas</i> a section of maritime charts, published
his <i>Zee-Atlas</i> in 1675, which contained
twenty-seven charts, eight of which were American;
and in 1676 Arent Roggeveen issued his
well-known navigator’s chart-book, which in English
is known as <i>The Burning Fen</i> (1676), and
which also has a Spanish dress (1680). It gives in
successive charts the whole eastern coast of the
two Americas, on a large scale. Johann van
Keulen, who had published a chart of the coast
from Nantucket to Trinidad in 1680, issued a
<i>Zee-Atlas</i> in 1682-1687, based in part upon Van
Loon, enlarging it in successive issues, so that
in the edition of 1694 it had 146 charts, of which
38 were American. A later edition in 1734
contained 12 large folded charts of American
coasts.<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<p>Near the close of the century we come to
the earliest of the French marine atlases, the
<i>Neptune Français</i>, which Jaillot published in its
enlarged form in 1693; but not till a <i>Suite du

<p class="pf250">Except for the supposed
inland sea, much
the same configuration
of Nova Francia is given
in the map of not
far from this date which
Hondius made to illustrate
Drake’s voyage,
and of which a fac-simile
is given in the Hakluyt Society’s edition of <i>The World Encompassed</i>. The same general character belongs
to the Hondius map in the 1613 edition of Mercator; while in the same book the <i>Orbis Terræ compendiosa
Descriptio</i> is very nearly of the original Mercator and Ortelius type, which is also closely followed in a second
map, <i>America, sive India nova, per Michælem Mercatorem</i>. Another map of the same date is in Megiser’s
<i>Septentrio Novantiquus</i>, Leipsic, 1613.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">IN the notes at the end of chapter ii. we followed
the cartography of New France down
to the opening of the seventeenth century. We
saw in the map of Molineaux (1600) an indication
of a great inland sea, as the prototype of
the Great Lakes; but the general belief of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
period, just as Champlain was entering on his
discoveries, is well shown in the map, “Americæ
sive Novi Orbis nova Descriptio,” which
appeared in Botero’s <i>Relaciones universales</i>, published
at Valladolid in 1603.<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a></p>

<p>The Spanish and the Dutch only repeated,
but hardly with as much precision, what the map
in Botero had shown;<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> and we only get approximate
exactness when we come to the map
of Lescarbot in 1609, of which sections are
given in the present and in other chapters.<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a>
Champlain’s first map was made in 1612, and
his second in 1613,<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a> both of which appeared in
<i>Les Voyages du Sieur de Champlain</i>, Paris, 1613.
Between the issue of these 1612 and 1613 maps
of Champlain and his greater one in 1632, the
cartography of New France is illustrated by
several conspicuous maps. Those of Hondius
and Mercator, so called, of the same year were
of course unaffected by the drafts of Champlain.
We begin to notice some effects of
Champlain’s work, however, in several of the
Dutch maps; in that of Jacobsz, or Jacobsen,
of 1621, for instance, of which account will be
found on another page.<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a> Maps by Jodocus
Hondius and Blaeu represent a number of
streams flowing from small lakes uniting to
form the St. Lawrence. One by Jannson, in
1626, nearly resembles for the St. Lawrence region
that portion of a “new and accurate
map of the world, 1626,” which makes part of
Speed’s <i>Prospect of the most famous Parts of the
World</i>.</p>

<p>In 1625 the <i>Pilgrimes</i><a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> of Purchas introduces
us to two significant maps. One is that which
Sir William Alexander issued in his <i>Encouragement
to Colonies</i> in 1624, and was reproduced by
Purchas, calling it “New England, New Scotland,
and New France.” The essential part of it
is given in Vol. III. chap. ix. The other is that
called “The North Part of America,” ascribed
to Master Briggs.</p>

of the mouth of the St. Lawrence River of about this date, copied from one in the Dépôt de la Marine at Paris.
Kohl also includes a map by Joannes Oliva, copied from a manuscript portolano among the Egerton Manuscripts
in the British Museum, which purports to have been made at Marseilles in 1613. Its names and
legends are Italian and Latin; and the map, while inferior to Hakluyt’s map, bears a strong resemblance to it.
It is much behind the time, except as respects the outline of Newfoundland, which seems to be more accurately
drawn than before. This island was still further to be improved in Mason’s map of 1626. Oliva seems to
have been ignorant of Lescarbot’s book.</p>

Harrisse, nos. 306-318, enumerates the proper maps of this 1613 edition. The title of the 1613 edition speaks

<p>It will be observed that Champlain had
reached, in his plotting of the country east of
the Penobscot, something more than tolerable
accuracy. Farther west, proportions and relations
were all wrong. The country between the
St. Lawrence and the Gulf of Maine is much
too narrow. The Penobscot is made almost
to unite with the more northern river; and
this error is perpetuated in the Dutch maps
published by Blaeu, and Covens and Mortier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
many years later. The placing of Lake Champlain
within a short distance of Casco Bay was
another error that the later Dutch cartographers
adopted in one form or another. Lake Ontario
is not greatly misshapen; but Erie is stretched
into a strait, while beyond a distorted Huron
a “grand lac” is so placed as to leave a doubt
if Superior or Michigan was intended.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this pronounced belief in
large inland seas, and the publication of the
belief, the notion did not make converts in
every direction. Two years later (1634) a map
of Petrus Kærius, and even his other map,
which appeared in Speed’s <i>Prospect of the most
famous Parts of the World</i>, published in London,
gave no intimation of Champlain’s results. The
same backwardness of knowledge or apprehension
is apparent in the map which accompanies
the Amsterdam edition of Linschoten in 1644;
in that of the world, dated 1651, which appeared
in Speed’s 1676 edition; in the map in Petavius’s
<i>History of the World</i>, London, 1659; and in two
maps of N. I. Visscher, both dated 1652, which
make the St. Lawrence River rise in the neighborhood
of the Colorado. We might not expect
the <i>Zee-Atlas</i> of Van Loon to give signs of the
inland lakes; but it is strange that the map
“Americæ nova descriptio,” ignoring the great
interior waters, was used in editions of Heylin’s
<i>Cosmographie</i>, in London, from 1669 to
1677.</p>

             <p class="pf400">Cf. another section of De Laet’s map in chap. viii. De Laet was much better informed than Champlain
regarding the relative position of Lake Champlain to New England; and he placed it more in accordance
with the English belief, as expressed by Thomas Morton, <i>New English Canaan</i> (Adams’s edition, p. 234), who
speaks of Lake Champlain as being three hundred miles distant from Massachusetts Bay,&mdash;a distance somewhat
in excess. De Laet’s map is also given in Cassell’s <i>United States</i>, i. 240.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Some of the Dutch cartographers were not
so inalert. Johannes Jannson in his <i>America
septentrionalis</i>, and even Visscher himself in his
<i>Novissima et accuratissima totius Americæ Descriptio</i>
give diverse interpretations to this idea of
the inland seas. The draft in the Hexham English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
translation (1636) of the Mercator-Hondius
atlas is not much nearer that of Champlain.</p>

<p>Harrisse (<i>Notes</i>, etc.,
nos. 190, 191) refers to two
charts of the St. Lawrence
of 1641 which are preserved
in Paris, and are
known to be the work of
Jean Bourdon, who came
to Quebec in 1633-34.
Perhaps one of these is the
same referred to by Kohl,
as dated 1635, and in the
<i>Dépôt de la Marine</i>, of
which a copy is in the
Kohl Collection in the
State Department at
Washington. Harrisse
also (no. 324) refers to a
<i>Description de la Nouvelle
France</i>,&mdash;a map published
by Boisseau in Paris in
1643.</p>

<p>The map in Dudley’s
<i>Arcano del Mare</i> (Florence,
1647), called “Carta particolare della terra
nuova, con la gran Baia et il Fiume grande della
Canida: D’America, carta prima,”<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a> presents a
surprise in making the St. Croix River connect
the Bay of Fundy with the St. Lawrence; and
Dudley seems to have had very confused notions
of the sites of Hochelaga and the Saguenay.
The annexed sketch is much reduced.</p>

<p>The same transverse strait appears in <i>Carte
générale des Costes de l’Amérique</i>, published at
Amsterdam by Covens and Mortier. A treatment
of the geographical problem of the lakes
which had more or less vogue, is shown in
Gottfried’s <i>Neue Welt</i>, 1655, in a map called
“America noviter delineate;” and this same
treatment was preserved by Blaeu so late as
1685.</p>

<p>A most decided advance came with the map,
<i>Le Canada, ou Nouvelle France</i>, of Nicolas Sanson
in 1656,<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a>&mdash;a far better correlation of the three

with Sanson was the English geographer
Peter Heylin, whose map, as has already
been noted, betrays no knowledge of Champlain.
His <i>Cosmographie in Four Books</i> appeared in
1657,<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a> and the second part of the fourth book
relates to America, and is accompanied by the

little notice as contributions to knowledge.<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a></p>

        <p class="pf400">The great map of 1632, by Champlain, has been reproduced full size in the Quebec edition of his works, and also in the Prince
Society edition. A fac-simile, somewhat reduced, is given in O’Callaghan’s <i>Documentary History of New York</i>, vol. iii. Another,
full size, was made by Pilinski in 1860, and published by Tross, of Paris (thirty-six copies, and of date, 1877, fifty copies at 40
francs). Field calls it “imperfect.” Brunet, however, says it has “une admirable exactitude.” The copy of the 1632 edition in the
Bibliothèque Nationale lacks this map. The Harvard Le Mur copy has no map (Field, <i>Indian Bibliography</i>,
no. 268).</p>

<p class="pf400">Sabin (no. 11,839) says that the map here copied (the original of which is in the Harvard College “Collet”
copy) belongs properly to the copies having the Le Mur and Sevestre imprints, and has the legend, “Faict
l’an 1632 par le Sieur de Champlain;” while the proper Collet map is smaller, and is inscribed, “Faict par le
Sieur de Champlain, suivant les Mémoires de P. du Val, en l’Isle du Palais.” The earliest copy, however, which
I have found of the map thus referred to bears date 1664, and is called <i>Le Canada, faict par le S<sup>r</sup>. de Champlain,
... suivant les Mémoires de P. du Val, Géographe du Roy</i>. This map appeared with even later dates (1677,
etc.), preserving much of the characteristics of the 1632 map, though stretching the plot farther west, and at a
time when much better knowledge was current. Harrisse, nos. 331, 348; but cf. no. 274. Kohl, in the Department
of State Collection, has one of date 1660.</p>

<p>If we run through the series of maps here
sketched, we cannot but be struck with the unsettled
notions regarding the geography of the
St. Lawrence Valley. Beginning with the clear
intimation by Molineaux, in 1600, of a great
body of interior water, which was the mysterious
link between the Atlantic and the Arctic
seas, and finding this idea modified by Botero
and others, we see Champlain in 1613 still leaving
it vague. The maps of the next few years
paid little attention to any features farther west
than the limit of tide-water; and not till we
reach the great map which accompanied the
final edition of Champlain’s collected voyages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
in 1632 do we begin to get a distorted plot of
the upper lakes, Lake Erie being nothing more
than a channel of varying width connecting
them with Lake Huron. The first really serviceable
delineation of the great lakes were the
maps of Sanson and Du Creux, or Creuxius,
in 1656 and 1660. Here we find Lake Erie
given its due prominence; Huron is unduly
large, but in its right position; and Michigan
and Superior, though not completed, are placed
with approximate accuracy. This truth of position,
however, was disregarded by many a later
geographer, till we reach a type of map, about
the end of the century, which is exemplified in
that given by Campanius in 1702.</p>

<p>A water-way which made an island of greater
or less extent of the peninsula which lies between
the St. Lawrence and the Atlantic, appeared
first in 1600 on the Molineaux map, and
was repeated by Dudley in 1647; but on other
maps the water-sheds were separated by a narrow
tract. So much uncertainty attended this
feature that the short portage of the prevailing
notion was far from constant in its position, and
on some maps seems repeated in more than one
place,&mdash;taking now the appearance of a connection
on the line of the St. Croix, or some
other river of New Brunswick; now on that of
the Kennebec and Chaudière; again as if having
some connection with Lake Champlain, when
a misconception of its true position placed that
expanse of water between the Connecticut and
the Saco; and once more on the line of the
Hudson and Lake George.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="pc1 lmid">NEW NETHERLAND, OR THE DUTCH IN NORTH AMERICA</p>

<p class="pc1">BY BERTHOLD FERNOW,</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct"><i>Keeper of the Historical Records, State of New York</i>.</p>

<p class="drop-cap08">SAYS Carlyle: “Those Dutch are a strong people. They raised their
land out of a marsh, and went on for a long period of time breeding
cows and making cheese, and might have gone on with their cows and
cheese till doomsday. But Spain comes over and says, ‘We want you to
believe in St. Ignatius.’ ‘Very sorry,’ replied the Dutch, ‘but we can’t.’
‘God! but you <i>must</i>,’ says Spain; and they went about with guns and
swords to make the Dutch believe in St. Ignatius. Never made them
believe in him, but did succeed in breaking their own vertebral column
forever, and raising the Dutch into a great nation.”</p>

<p>A nation’s struggle for religious liberty comes upon every individual
member of that nation as a personal matter, as a battle to be fought with
himself and with the world. Hence we see the Dutch, encouraged by the
large influx of Belgians whom the same unwillingness to believe in St.
Ignatius had driven out of their homes, emerge from the conflict with Spain,
individually and as a nation, more self-reliant, sturdy, and independent than
ever before.</p>

<p>Compelled by the physical condition of their country to become a maritime
nation, while other circumstances directed them to commercial pursuits,
they had long been the common carriers of the sea, and had availed
themselves at an early date of the discoveries made by the Cabots, Verrazano,
and other adventurous explorers in the century succeeding the
voyages of Columbus. They had studied the weak points of that vast
Spanish empire “where the sun never set,” and found in the war with
Spain a good excuse to make use of their knowledge, and to send their ships
to the West Indies and the Spanish main to prey upon the commerce of
their enemies. The first proposition to make such an expedition, submitted
to the States-General in 1581 by an English sea-captain, Beets, and refused
by them, was undoubtedly conceived in a purely commercial spirit. Gradually
the idea of destroying the transatlantic resources of Spain, and thereby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
compelling her to submit to the Dutch conditions of peace and to the
evacuation of Belgium, caused the formation of a West India company,
which, authorized to trade with and fight the Spaniards in American waters,
appears in the light of a necessary political measure, without, however,
throwing in the background the necessity of finding a shorter route to
the East Indies.<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a></p>

<p>Although the scheme to form a West India company was first broached
in 1592 by William Usselinx, an exiled Antwerp merchant, it was many years
before it could be carried out. The longing for a share in the riches of the
New World conduced in the mean time to the establishment of the “Greenland
Company” about 1596, and the pretended search by its ships for a
northwest passage led to a supposed first discovery of the Hudson River, if
we may rely upon an unsupported statement made by officers of the West
India Company in an appeal for assistance to the Assembly of the Nineteen
in 1644. According to this document, ships of the Greenland Company had
entered the North and Delaware rivers in 1598; their crews had landed in
both places, and had built small forts to protect them against the inclemency
of the winter and to resist the attacks of the Indians.</p>

<p>Of the next adventurer who sailed through the Narrows we know more,
and of his discoveries we have documentary evidence. A company of
English merchants had organized to trade to America in the first years of
the seventeenth century. Their first adventures, directed to Guiana and
Virginia, were not successful,<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a> yet gave a new impetus to the scheme originally
conceived by Usselinx. A plan for the organization of a West India
company was drawn up in 1606, according to the exiled Belgian’s ideas.
The company was to be in existence thirty-six years, to receive during the
first six years assistance from all the United Provinces, and to be managed
in the same manner as the East India Company. Political considerations
on one side and rivalry between the Provinces on the other prevented the
consummation of this project. A peace or truce with Spain was about to
be negotiated, and Oldenbarnevelt, then Advocate of Holland and one of
the most prominent and influential members of the peace party, foresaw
that the organization of a West India company with the avowed purpose of
obtaining most of its profits by preying on Spanish commerce in American
waters would only prolong the war. Probably he saw still farther. Usselinx’s
plan was, as we have seen, to compel Spain by these means to evacuate
Belgium, and thus give her exiled sons a chance to return to their
old homes. A wholesale departure of the shrewd, industrious, and skilled
Belgians would have deprived Holland of her political pre-eminence and
have left her an obscure and isolated province. On the other hand, each
province and each seaport desired a share in the equipping of the fleet destined
to sail in the interests of the proposed company, and as no province<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
was willing to allow a rival to have what she could not have, the project
itself between these two extremes of the opposing parties came to nought.
It was only when Oldenbarnevelt, accused of high treason, had been lodged
in prison, and the renewal of the war with Spain had been commended to
the public, that the scheme was taken up again, in 1618.</p>

<p>Private ships, sailing from Dutch ports, had not been idle in the mean
time; in 1607 we hear of them in Canada trading for furs, and in 1609 an
English mariner, Henry Hudson, who had made several voyages for the
English company already mentioned, offered his services to the East India
Company to search for the passage to India by the north.</p>

<p>Under the auspices of the Amsterdam chamber of this company
Hudson left the Texel in the yacht “Half Moon” April 4, 1609. His
failures in the years 1607 and 1608, while in the employ of the English
company, had discouraged neither him nor his new employers; but soon
ice and fogs compel him, so we are told, to abandon his original plan to go
to the East Indies by a possible northeast passage, and he proposes to his
crew a search for a northwest passage along the American coast, at about
the 40th degree of latitude. A contemporary writer states: “This idea had
been suggested to Hudson by some letters and maps which his friend
Captain Smith had sent him from Virginia, and by which he informed him
that there was a sea leading into the Western Ocean by the north of Virginia.”
So westward Hudson turns the bow of his ship, to make a first landfall
on the coast of Newfoundland, a second at Penobscot Bay, and a third
at Cape Cod. Thence he takes a southwest course, but again fails to strike
land under the 40th degree; he has gone too far south by one degree, and he
anchors in a wide bay under 39° 5″ on the 28th of August. He is in Delaware
Bay. Scarcely a week later, on the 4th of September, he finds himself
with his yacht in the “Great North River of New Netherland,” under 40°
30´. A month later, to a day, he passes again out of the “Great mouth of
the Great River,” homeward bound to report that what he had thought to
be the long and vainly sought northwest passage was only a great river,
navigable for vessels of light draught for one hundred and fifty miles, and
running through a country fair to look upon and inhabited by red men
peacefully inclined. Little did Hudson think, while he was navigating the
waters named for him, that Champlain, another explorer, had recently been
fighting his way up the shores of the lake now bearing his name, and that,
a century and a half later, the great battle for supremacy on this continent
between France and England,&mdash;between the old religion and the new,&mdash;would
be fiercely waged in those peaceful regions.</p>

<p>The report brought home by Hudson, that the newly discovered country
abounded in fur-bearing animals, created the wildest excitement among a
people compelled by their northern climate to resort to very warm clothing
in winter. Many private ventures, therefore, followed Hudson’s track soon
after his return, and finally the plan to organize a West India company,
never quite relinquished, was now, 1618, destined to be carried out. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
was in this juncture less opposition to it; but still various reasons delayed
the consent of the States-General until June, 1621, when at last they signed
the charter. Englishmen from Virginia, who claimed the country under a
grant, had tried to oust the Dutch, who had before this established themselves
on the banks of the Hudson, under the <i>octroi</i> of 1614. The West
India Company nevertheless, undismayed, took possession, in 1623, by
sending Captain Cornelis Jacobsen Mey as director to the Prince Hendrick
or South River (Delaware), and Adrian Jorissen Tienpont in like capacity
to the Prince Mauritius or North River. Mey, going up the South River,
fifteen leagues from its mouth erected in the present town of Gloucester,
N. J., about four miles below Philadelphia, Fort Nassau, the first European
settlement in that region; while the director on the North River, besides
strengthening the establishment which he found at its mouth, built a fort a
few miles above the one erected in 1618 near the mouth of the Normanskil,
now Albany, by the servants of the “United New Netherland Company,”
and called it “Fort Orange.”</p>

         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>Tienpont’s successor, Peter Minuit, three years later, in 1626, bought
from the Indians the whole of Manhattan Island for the value of about
twenty-four dollars, with
the view of making this
the principal settlement.
This purchase and the organization, under the charter, of a council
with supreme executive, legislative, and judicial authority, must be considered
the first foundation of our present State of New York, even
though the titles of the officers constituting the council,&mdash;upper and
under merchant, commissary, book-keeper of monthly wages,&mdash;seem to
prove that in the beginning the Company had only purely commercial
ends in view. Their charter of 1621, it is true, required them “to advance
the peopling of those fruitful and unsettled parts,” but not until the trade
with New Netherland threatened to become unprofitable, in 1627-28, was a
plan taken into consideration to reap other benefits than those accruing
from the fur-trade alone, through a more extended colonization. The deliberations
of the Assembly of the Nineteen and directors of the West India
Company resulted in a new “charter of freedoms and exemptions,” sanctioned
by the States-General, June 7, 1629. Its provisions, no more favorable
to liberty, as we understand it now, than that of 1621, attempted to
transplant to the soil of New York the feudal system of Europe as it
had already been established in Canada; and with it was imported the first
germ of that weakening disease,&mdash;inadequate revenues,&mdash;which caused
the colony to fall such an easy prey to England’s attack in 1664. While
the charter was still under discussion, several of the Company’s directors
took advantage of their position and secured for themselves a share of the
new privileges by purchasing from the Indians, as the charter required,
the most conveniently located and fertile tracts of land. The records of
the acknowledgment of these transactions before the Director and Council<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
of the Colony are the earliest which are extant in the original now in the
possession of the State of New York. They bear dates from April, 1630, to
July, 1631, and include the present counties of Albany and Richmond,
N. Y., the cities of Hoboken and Jersey City, N. J., and the southern
parts of the States of New Jersey and Delaware.</p>

<p>This mode of acquiring lands from the Indians by purchase established
from the beginning the principles by which the intercourse between the
white and the red men in the valley of the Hudson was to be regulated.
The great Indian problem, which has been and still is a question of paramount
importance to the United States Government, was solved then by
the Dutch of New Netherland without great difficulty. Persecuted by
Spain and France for their religious convictions, the Dutch had learned to
tolerate the superstitions and even repugnant beliefs of others. Not less
religious than the Puritans of New England, they made no such religious
pretexts for tyranny and cruelty as mar the records of their neighbors.
They treated the Indian as a man with rights of life, liberty, opinion, and
property like their own. Truthful among themselves, they inspired in the
Indian a belief in their sincerity and honesty, and purchased what they
wanted fairly and with the consent of the seller. The Dutch <i>régime</i> always
upheld this principle, and as a consequence the Indians of this State caused
no further difficulty, with a few exceptions, to the settlers than a financial
outlay. The historians who charge the Dutch with pusillanimity and cowardice
in their dealings with the Indians forget that to their policy we owe
to-day the existence of the United States.</p>

<p>The country between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mississippi River, the
Great Lakes and the Savannah River, was at the time of the arrival of the
Dutch practically ruled by a confederacy of Indian tribes,&mdash;the Five Nations,&mdash;who,
settled along the Mohawk and Upper Hudson rivers and in western
New York, commanded the key to the continent. It was indeed in their
power, had they pleased, to allow the French of Canada to crush the Dutch
settlements on the Hudson; and had this territory become a French province,
the united action of the American colonies in the French and Revolutionary
wars would have been an impossibility. These Five Nations, called
by the Jesuit fathers living among them the most enlightened but also the
most intractable and ferocious of all the Indians, became soon after the
arrival of the Dutch the stanch friends of the new-comers, and remained so
during the whole Dutch period. The English wisely adhered to this Indian
policy of the Dutch, and by the continued friendship of the Five Nations
were enabled successfully to contend with the French for the supremacy on
this continent.</p>

<p>The purchasers of the tracts already mentioned&mdash;with one exception,
associations of Dutch merchants&mdash;lost no time in sending out people to
settle their colonies. Renselaerswyck, adjoining and surrounding Fort
Orange, had in 1630 already a population of thirty males, of whom several
had families, sent out by the Association recognizing Kilian van<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
Renselaer, a pearl merchant of Amsterdam, as patroon. The same men,
associated with several others, among whom was Captain David Pietersen
de Vries, had bought the present counties of Sussex and Kent, in the State
of Delaware, to
which by a purchase
made the
following year
they added the
present Cape
May County,
N. J. On December 12, 1630, they sent two vessels to the Delaware or
South River, “to plant a colony for the cultivation of grain and tobacco,
as well as to carry on the whale-fishery in that region.” They carried out
the first part of the plan, but were so unsuccessful in the second part that
the expedition proved a losing one. Undismayed by their financial loss,
another was sent out in May, 1632, under Captain de Vries’ personal command,
although information had been received that the settlement on the
South River, Zwanendael, had been destroyed by the Indians, and all the
settlers, thirty-two in number, killed. Arriving opposite Zwanendael, De
Vries found the news but too true; and after visiting the old Fort Nassau,
now deserted, and loitering a while in the river, he left the region without
any further attempt at colonization. The pecuniary losses attending these
two unfortunate expeditions induced the patroons of Zwanendael, two years
later, to dispose of their right and title to these tracts of land to the West
India Company.</p>

<p>Shortly before Minuit was appointed director of New Netherland, a
number of Walloons, compelled by French intolerance to leave their homes
between the rivers Scheldt and Lys, had applied to Sir Dudley Carleton,
principal Secretary of State to King Charles I., for permission to settle in
Virginia. The answer of the Virginia Company not proving satisfactory,
they turned their eyes upon New Netherland, where a small number of them
arrived with Minuit. For some reasons they left the lands first allotted to
them on Staten Island, and went over to Long Island, where Wallabout,<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a> in
the city of Brooklyn, still reminds us of the origin of its first settlers. It
will be remembered that Englishmen from Virginia (under Captain Samuel
Argal, in 1613) had attempted to drive the Dutch from the Hudson River.<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a>
It is said that the Dutch then acknowledged the English title to this region
under a grant of Queen Elizabeth to Sir Walter Raleigh in 1584, and made
an arrangement for their continuing there on sufferance. Be that as it may,
the West India Company had paid no heed to this early warning. Now,
in 1627, the matter was to be recalled to their minds in a manner more
diplomatic than Argal’s, by a letter from Governor Bradford of Plymouth
Colony, which most earnestly asserted the right of the English to the territory
occupied by the Dutch. This urged the latter to clear their title, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
otherwise it said: “It will be harder and with more difficulty obtained hereafter,
and perhaps not without blows.” Before the director’s appeal for
assistance against possible English invaders reached the home office, the
Company had already taken steps to remove some of the causes which
might endanger their colony. They had obtained, September, 1627, from
King Charles I. an order giving to their vessels the same privileges as had
been granted by the treaty of Southampton to all national vessels of Holland,&mdash;that
is, freedom of trade to all ports of England and her colonies.
But their title to New Netherland was not cleared, because they could not do
it; for they did not dare to assert the pretensions to the <i>premier seisin</i>, then
considered valid according to that maxim of the civil law, “<i>quæ nullius
sunt, in bonis dantur occupanti</i>;” nor did they later claim the right of first
discovery when, after the surrender of New Netherland to the English, in
1664, negotiations were had concerning restitution. Only once did they
claim a title by such discovery. This was when the ship “Union,” bringing
home the recalled director Minuit (1632), was attached in an English port,
at the suit of the New England Company, on a charge which had been made
notwithstanding the King’s order of September, 1627, and which alleged
that the ship had obtained her cargo in countries subject to his Majesty.
The denial of this claim and the counter claim of first discovery by Englishmen
set up by the British ministry failed to bring forth a rejoinder
from their High Mightinesses of Holland.</p>

<p>When De Vries, having ascertained the destruction of his colony on the
Delaware, came to New Amsterdam, he found there the newly appointed
director, Wouter van Twiller, just arrived. He was, as De Vries thought,
“an unfit person,” whom family influence had suddenly raised from a clerkship
in the Company’s office
at Amsterdam to the governorship
of New Netherland
“to perform a comedy,”
and his council De Vries
calls “a pack of fools, who
knew nothing except to
drink, by whose management
the Company must come to nought.” De Vries’ prediction came near
being realized. Seized with a mania for territorial aggrandizement, Van
Twiller bought from the Indians a part of the Connecticut territory in 1633,
and by building Fort Hope, near the present site of Hartford, planted the
seed for another quarrel with the English at Boston, who claimed all the
land from the Narragansetts nearly to the Manhattans under a grant made
in 1631 to the Earl of Warwick, and under a subsequent transfer from the
latter in 1632 to Lord Say and Seal’s company. Notwithstanding their
numerical weakness, the Dutch kept a footing in Connecticut for nearly
twenty years; but they could not prevent the same Englishmen from invading
Long Island in a like manner, and being prominent actors in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
final catastrophe of 1664. Another purchase made by Van Twiller from
the Indians, also in 1633, which included the territory on the Schuylkill,
the building of Fort Beeversreede there and additions made to Fort Nassau,
put new life into the sinking settlement on the Delaware River, and
thus gave color to the subsequent statement, made in the dispute with the
Swedes, that they (the Dutch) had never relinquished their hold upon this
territory.<a name="FNanchor_784_784" id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a> Thoroughly imbued with a sense of the wealth and power of the
West India Company, then in the zenith of its power, Van Twiller expended
the revenues of his government lavishly in building up New Amsterdam
and Fort Orange, and, without regard for official ethics, abused his position
still further at the expense of the Company, by granting to himself and his
boon companions the most fertile tracts of land on and near Manhattan and
Long islands. His irregular proceedings, finally brought to the notice of
the States-General by the law officer of New Netherland, led to his recall
in 1637, when he was succeeded by William Kieft.</p>

<p>Up to this time the history of New Netherland is more or less a history
of the acts of the director, who proceeded more like the agent of a great
commercial institution than the ruler of a vast province. He assumed to
be the head of the agency, and all the other inhabitants of the colony were
either his servants or his tenants. Nominally he was also directed to
supervise the proceedings of adjoining colonies of the same nationality;
but they either died out, like Pavonia (New Jersey) and Zwanendael (Delaware),
or as yet the interests of those private establishments, like Renselaerswyck
(Albany) had not come in conflict with those of the Company
so as to call forth the authority vested in the director. The relations
with the Indians had also been amicable so far, a slight misunderstanding
with the New Jersey Indians excepted; and the quarrel with the English
about the Connecticut lands having been referred to the home authorities
for settlement, this complication did not require any display of statesmanship.
The province having been brought to the verge of ruin by Wouter
van Twiller, up to the beginning of whose administration it had returned
a profit of $75,000 to the Company, the abilities of his successor were
taxed to their utmost to rebuild it, and his statesmanship was tried in his
dealings with the Swedes, the English, and the Indians.</p>

<p>The absorption, for their own benefit, of the most fertile lands by
officers of the Company had naturally tended to prevent actual settlers
from coming to New Netherland, and the Company itself had thus far
failed to send over colonists, as required by the charter. The incessant
disputes between the Amsterdam department of the Company and the
patroons of Renselaerswyck over the interpretation of the privileges
granted in 1629, and the complaints of the fiscal<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a> of New Netherland
against Wouter van Twiller, which pointedly referred to the general maladministration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
of the province, at last induced their High Mightinesses to
turn their attention to it. A short investigation compelled them to announce
officially that the colony was retrograding, its population decreasing,
and that it required a change in the administration of its affairs. But
as the charter of the Company was the fundamental evil, the Government
was almost powerless to enforce its demands, and had to be satisfied
with recommending to the Assembly of the Nineteen of the West India
Company the adoption of a plan for the effectual settlement of the country
and the encouragement of a sound and healthful emigration. This step resulted
in overthrowing the monopoly of the American trade enjoyed by
the Company since 1623, and in opening not only the trade, but also the
cultivation of the soil under certain conditions, to every immigrant, denizen,
or foreigner. The new order of things gave to the drooping colony a fresh
lease of life. Its population, hitherto only transient, as it consisted mainly
of the Company’s servants, who returned to Europe at the expiration of
their respective terms, now became permanent,&mdash;“whole colonies” coming
“to escape the insupportable government of New England;” servants who
had obtained their liberty in Maryland and Virginia availing themselves of
the opportunity to make use of the experience acquired on the tobacco
plantations of their English masters; wealthy individuals of the more educated
classes emigrating with their families and importing large quantities
of stock; and the peasant farmers of continental Europe seeking freehold
homes on the banks of the Hudson and on Long Island, which they could
not acquire in the land of their birth. These all flocked now to New
Netherland, and gave to New Amsterdam something of its present cosmopolitan
character; for Father Jogues found there in 1643 eighteen different
nationalities represented by its population. Two other invasions, however,
of New Netherland brought a people likewise intent upon the cultivation of
the soil and trading with the Indians; but they were not such as “acknowledged
their High Mightinesses and the Directors of the West India Company
as their suzerain lords and masters,” and these caused some anxiety
and trouble to the new director.</p>

<p>The first of these invasions, arriving on this side of the Atlantic in
Delaware Bay almost simultaneously with Kieft, was made in pursuance
of a plan long cherished by the great Protestant hero of the seventeenth
century, Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, to give his country a share in the
harvest which other nations were then gathering in the New World. Various
reasons deferred the carrying out of this plan, first laid before the
King in 1626 by the same Usselinx who planned the West India Company;
and not until 1638 did the South Company of Sweden send out their first
adventure under another man, also formerly connected with the West India
Company, Peter Minuit.</p>

<p>Kieft’s protest against this intrusion had no effect upon the Swedish
commander and his colony, whose history is told in another chapter. More
energy was displayed by the Dutch two years later in dealing with some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
Englishmen from New Haven, who began a settlement on the Schuylkill
River, opposite Fort Nassau, and who were promptly driven away. Laxity
and corruption on the part of the Dutch local director seems to have been
the cause of the almost inexplicable patience with which the Dutch bore
the encroachments made by the Swedes; and not until the government of
New Netherland was intrusted to the energetic Stuyvesant was anything
done to counteract the Swedish influences on the Delaware. Stuyvesant
built in 1651 a new fort (Casimir, now Newcastle, Del.), below the Swedish
fort Christina (Wilmington), the treacherous surrender of which, in 1654, to
a newly arriving Swedish governor, led in 1655 to the complete overthrow
of Swedish rule.</p>

<p>The next two years, to 1657, the inhabitants of the Delaware territory
had to suffer under the mismanagement of various commanders appointed
by the Director-General and Council, whose lack of administrative talent
helped not a little to embarrass the Company financially. Under pressure of
monetary difficulty, part of the Delaware region was ceded by the Company
to the municipality of Amsterdam in Holland, which in May, 1657, established
a new colony at Fort Casimir, calling it New Amstel, while the name
of Christina was changed to Altena, and the territory belonging to it placed
in charge of an agent of more experience than his predecessors. The remaining
years of Dutch rule on the Delaware derive interest chiefly from
an attempt by comers from Maryland to obtain possession of the country
through a clever trick; from quarrels between the authorities of the two
Dutch colonies brought on by the weakness and folly of the directors of the
“City’s Colony;” and from difficulties with Maryland which arose out of
the Indian question. With the surrender of New Amsterdam in 1664, the
Delaware country passed also into English hands.</p>

<p>Historians have hitherto failed to give due weight to the attempt of Sweden
to establish this American colony, and to the effect it had upon the
fortunes of the West India Company. The expedition of 1655, although
politically successful, not only exhausted the ready means of the New
Netherland Government, but also plunged it and the Company into debts
which never ceased to hamper its movement, and which afterward rendered
it impossible to furnish the province a sufficient military protection.</p>

<p>But no less a share in the final result of 1664 is due to the second invasion
of the Dutch territory, made about the time when the Swedes first appeared
on the Delaware, by Englishmen crossing over from Connecticut to the
east end of Long Island. The whole island had been granted by the Plymouth
Company to the Earl of Stirling in 1635; and basing their claims on
patents issued by Forrest, the Earl’s agent in America, the invaders quickly
settled in the present County of Suffolk (1640), and resisted all efforts of
the Dutch to drive them off. Prejudicial to the Company’s interests as these
encroachments upon their territory were, they were calculated to call forth
all the administrative and diplomatic talents of which Kieft was supposed
to be possessed; but unfortunately by his lack of these qualities he contrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
to lay the colony open to a danger which almost destroyed it. The
trade with the interior had led to an intimacy between the Indians and the
Dutch which gave the natives many chances to acquaint themselves thoroughly
with the habits, strength, and usages of the settlers; while the increased
demand for peltries required that the Indians should be supplied
with better means to meet that demand. They were consequently given
firearms; and when thus put on the same footing with the white inhabitants,
Kieft committed the folly of exacting from them a tribute as a return for
aiding them in their defence against their enemies by the building of forts
and by the maintenance of a military establishment. He even threatened
to use forcible measures in cases of non-compliance. The war resulting
from this policy lasted until 1645, and seriously impaired the finances of
the Company and the development of the colony. Equally arbitrary
and devoid of common-sense was Kieft’s administration of internal affairs.
Before the beginning of the Indian war, upon which he was intent, circumstances
compelled him to make a concession to popular rights, which
he might use as a cloak to protect himself against censure. He directed
that the community at large should elect twelve delegates to consult
with the Director and Council on the expediency of going to war, and
when fairly launched into the conflict he quickly abolished this advisory
board,&mdash;the first representative body of New York,&mdash;but only to ask for an
expression of the public opinion by another board a few months later in
1643. This, at last disgusted with Kieft’s tyranny and folly, set to work to
have him removed in 1647. The people had not forgotten that in the
Netherlands they had been self-governing, and had enjoyed the rights of
free municipalities. Although all the minor towns had acquired the same
privileges almost at the beginning of their existence, New Amsterdam, the
principal place of the colony, was still ruled by the Company through
the Director and Council. The opposition which he met from the burghers
of this place was the principal cause of his recall.</p>

<p>The relations of New Netherland with its English neighbors during
Kieft’s administration were in the main the same as under his predecessors.
He continued to complain of the grievous wrongs and injuries inflicted
upon his people by New Haven, but had no means to do more than complain.
The stronger English colonies kept their settlement on the Connecticut,
and established another within the territory claimed by the Dutch
at Agawam, now Springfield, Mass.</p>

<p>The arrival of the new director-general was celebrated by the inhabitants
of New Amsterdam with all the solemnity which circumstances afforded;
and they were pleased to hear him announce that he “should be in his
government as a father to his children for the advantage of the Company,
the country, and the burghers.” They had good reasons to be hopeful.
Petrus Stuyvesant, the new director, had gathered administrative experience
as governor of the Company’s Island of Curaçao, and while in Holland on
sick leave, in 1645, he had proved his knowledge of New Netherland affairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
by offering acceptable suggestions for the better management of this and
the other transatlantic territories of the Company. His views, together with
instructions drawn up by the Assembly of the Nineteen for the guidance
of the director, were embodied in resolutions and orders for the future
government of New Netherland,
which revolutionized
and liberalized the
condition of the colony.
It was henceforth to be
governed by the Director-General
and a Council composed of the vice-director and the fiscal. The
right of the people to be heard by the provincial government on the state
and condition of the country, through delegates from the various settlements,
was confirmed; and the carrying trade between the colony and other
countries, which the reform of 1639 had still left in the hands of the Company
and of a few privileged persons, was now opened to all, although under
certain rather onerous restrictions.</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-406.jpg" width="250" height="81" id="i406"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>The first few months of the new administration fully justified the hope
with which Stuyvesant’s arrival had been accompanied. The state in which
Kieft had left the public morals compelled Stuyvesant to issue and enforce
such orders, that within two months of his assuming the new duties the
director of the Patroons’ Colony at Albany wrote home: “Mynheer Stuyvesant
introduces here a thorough reform.” What the state of things must
have been may be inferred from Stuyvesant’s declaration that “the people
are without discipline, and approaching the savage state,” while “a fourth
part of the city of New Amsterdam consists of rumshops and houses where
nothing can be had but beer and tobacco.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately for his own reputation and for the good of the colony, he
used his energies not solely to make provisions for future good government,
but he allowed his feudal notions to embroil him in the quarrels of the
late administration, by espousing the cause of Kieft, who had been accused
by representatives of the commonalty of malfeasance in office. This grave
error induced the home authorities to consider Stuyvesant’s recall; but
he was finally allowed to remain, and in the end proved the most satisfactory
administrator of the province sent out by the Company. It was
his and the Company’s misfortune that he was appointed when the resources
of the Company were gradually diminishing in consequence of the peace
with Spain. He was thus constantly hampered by a lack of means; and
when the end came, he had only from one hundred and fifty to two hundred
soldiers, scattered in four garrisons from the Delaware forts to Fort Orange,
to defend the colony against an overwhelming English force.</p>

<p>During the seventeen years of his administration Stuyvesant endeavored
to cultivate the friendship of the Indians; and in this he was in the main
successful, save that the tribes of the Mohegan nation along the Hudson
refused to become as firm friends of the Dutch as their suzerain lords,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
the Mohawks, were. While Stuyvesant was absent on the South River, in
1655, to subdue, in obedience to orders from home, the Swedish settlements
there, New Amsterdam was invaded by the River Indians and almost destroyed.
The Colony and the Company had not yet recovered from the
losses sustained by this invasion, nor from the draft made upon their financial
resources by the successful expedition against the Swedes, when a few
tribes of the same River Indians reopened the war against the Dutch.
They first murdered some individuals of the settlement on the Esopus
(now Kingston, Ulster County), and later destroyed it almost completely.
With an expense at the time altogether out of proportion to the means
of the Government, Stuyvesant succeeded in 1663 in ending this war by
destroying the Esopus tribe of Indians.</p>

<p>The negotiations with the New England colonies for a settlement of the
boundary and other open questions fall into the earlier part of Stuyvesant’s
administration. Although he could flatter himself that he had obtained in
the treaty of Hartford, 1650, as good terms as he might expect from a power
vastly superior to his own, his course only tended to separate the two factions
of New Netherland still farther. His espousal of Kieft’s cause had,
as we have seen, alienated him from the mass of his countrymen, whose
anger was now still more aroused when he selected as advisers at Hartford
an Englishman resident at New Amsterdam and a Frenchman. He was
accused of having betrayed his trust because he had been obliged to surrender
the jurisdiction of the Company over the Connecticut territory and
the east end of Long Island. Listening to these accusations, coming together
as they did with the Kieft affair, the Company increased the difficulties
surrounding their director by an order to make Dutch nationality
one of the tests of fitness for public employment.</p>

<p>The people had already in Kieft’s time loudly called for more liberty,&mdash;a
desire which Stuyvesant in the strong conservatism of his character
was by no means willing to listen to. As, however, liberal principles
gained more and more ground among the population, he at last gave his
consent to the convocation of a general assembly from the several towns,
which was to consider the state of the province. It was too late. The
power of the Dutch in New Netherland was waning; Connecticut had
been lost in 1650; Westchester at the very door of the Manhattans, and the
principal towns of western Long Island were in the hands of the English;
and a few months after the first meeting of the delegates the English flag
floated over the fort, which had until then been called New Amsterdam.</p>

<p>The magnitude of the commerce of the United Provinces had long been
a thorn in the side of the English nation; for years Cato’s <i>Ceterum censeo,
Carthaginem esse delendam</i> had been the burden of political speeches.
Differences arising between the two governments, Charles II., only lately
the guest of Holland, allowed himself to be persuaded by his chancellor,
Shaftesbury, that this commerce would make Holland as great an empire
as Rome had been, and this would lead to the utter annihilation of England.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
There was apparently no other motive reflecting “honor upon his prudence,
activity, and public spirit,” to induce him to order the treacherous
expedition which seized the territory of an unsuspecting ally.</p>

<p>When the English fleet appeared off the coast of Long Island the Dutch
were not at all prepared to offer resistance, their small military force of
about two hundred effective men being scattered in detachments over the
whole province. Nevertheless Stuyvesant would have let the issue be decided
by arms; but the people failed to support him, and insisted upon a
surrender, which was accordingly made. They had not forgotten how he
had treated their demands for greater liberty, and they expected to be
favorably heard by an English government. New Amsterdam, fort and
city, as well as the whole province were named by the victors in honor of
the new proprietor, the Duke of York; while the region west of the Hudson
towards the Delaware, given by the Duke to Lord Berkeley and Sir George
Carteret, received the name of New Jersey in compliment to the latter’s
birthplace. Fort Orange and neighborhood became Albany; the Esopus,
Kingston, and all reminiscences of Dutch rule, so far as names went, were
extinguished, only to be revived less than a decade later.</p>

<div class="floatright">

</div>

<p>Although the treaty of Breda, July 21, 1667, had given to Holland
(which by it was robbed of her North American territory) the colony of
Surinam, the States took advantage of the war brought on by the ambitious
designs of England’s ally, France, against Holland in 1672, to retake
New Netherland in 1673. Again the several towns and districts changed
their names,&mdash;New York to New Orange; Fort James in New York to
Willem Hendrick; Albany to Willemstadt, and the fort there to Fort Nassau,&mdash;all
in honor of the Prince of Orange. Kingston was called Swanenburg;
and New Jersey, Achter Col (behind the Col). During the first
few months after the reconquest the province was governed by the naval
commanders and the governor, Anthony Colve, appointed by the States-General.
The passionate character of the new governor may have induced
the commanders to remain until matters were satisfactorily arranged under
the new order of things. The different towns and villages were required
to send delegates to New Orange with authority and for the purpose of
acknowledging their allegiance to the States-General of Holland. All submitted
promptly, with the exception of the five towns of the East Riding
of Yorkshire on Long Island, which, however, upon a threat of using force
if they would not come with their English colors and constables’ staves,
also declared their willingness to take the oath of allegiance. A claim
upon Long Island, petitions from three of its eastern towns to New England
for “protection and government against the Dutch,” and an arrogant
attempt made by Governor Winthrop of New Haven to lecture Colve,
forced the latter into an attitude of war, which resulted in a bloodless rencontre
between the Dutch and the English from Connecticut at Southold,
Long Island, in March, 1674. “Provisional Instructions” for the government
of the province, drawn up by Colve, estranged and annoyed its English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
inhabitants, who were declared ineligible for any office if not in communion
with the Reformed Protestant Church, in conformity with the Synod of
Dort. Therefore, when, after the failure of receiving reinforcements from
home, New Netherland
was re-surrendered
to England
(February, 1674), the
States-General being
obliged to take this step by the necessity of making European alliances,
the English portion of the population were glad to greet (November,
1674) again a government of their own nationality, and the Dutch had
to submit with the best possible grace.</p>

<h3><a name="c409" id="c409">CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION.</a></h3>

<p class="drop-cap08">OUR sources for the history of New Netherland are principally the official records of
the time, which must be considered under two heads: the records of the governments
in Europe which directly or indirectly were interested in this part of the world; and
the documents of the provincial government, handed down from secretary to secretary, and
now carefully preserved in the archives of the State of New York. Of the former we
have copies, the procuring of which by the State was one of the epoch-making events in
the annals of historiography. A society, formed in 1804<a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> in the city of New York for the
principal purpose of “collecting and preserving whatever may relate to the natural, civil,
or ecclesiastical history of the United States in general and the State of New York in particular,”
having memorialized the State Legislature on the subject, a translation was ordered
and made of the Dutch records in the office of the Secretary of State. This translation&mdash;of
which more hereafter&mdash;undoubtedly threw light upon the historical value and importance
of the State archives, but proved also their incompleteness; and another memorial by the
same society induced the Legislature of 1839 to authorize the appointment of an agent
who should procure from the archives of Europe the material to fill the gaps. Mr. John
Romeyn Brodhead, who by a residence of two years at the Hague as Secretary of the
American Legation seemed to be specially fitted for, and was already to some extent
familiar with, the duties expected from him, was appointed such an agent in 1841, and
after four years of diligent search and labor returned with eighty volumes of manuscript
copies of documents procured in Holland, France, and England, which were published
under his own and Dr. E. B. O’Callaghan’s supervision<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> as <i>Documents relating to the
Colonial History of New York</i>, eleven volumes quarto, including index volume. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
historical value of these documents, which the State procured at an expense of about
fourteen thousand dollars, can not be estimated too highly. When made accessible to
the public, they removed the reproach that “New York was probably the only commonwealth
whose founders had been covered with ridicule” by one of her sons, by showing
that the endurance, courage, and love of liberty evinced by her first settlers deserved a
better monument than <i>Knickerbocker’s History of New York</i>.<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a>

Mr. Brodhead was unfortunately too late by twenty years to obtain copies of the
records of the East and West India companies; for what would have proved a rich
mine of historical information had been sold as waste paper at public auction in 1821.
These lost records would have told us what the Dutch of 1608-1609 knew of our continent;
how Hudson came to look for a northwest passage under the fortieth degree of north
latitude; and how, where, and when the first settlements were made on the Hudson and
Delaware,&mdash;information which they certainly must have contained, for the States-General
referred the English ambassador, in a letter of Dec. 30, 1664, to the “very perfect registers,
relations, and journals of the West India Company, provided with all the requisite verifications
respecting everything that ever occurred in those countries” (New Netherland).
We cannot glean this information from the records of the provincial government, consisting
of the register of the provincial secretary, the minutes of council, letter-books, and land
papers, for they begin only in 1638, a few land patents of 1630, 1631, and 1636 excepted.
Even what we have of these is not complete, all letters prior to 1646 and council minutes
for nearly four years having been lost. Where these missing parts may have strayed, it
is hard to say. Article 12 of the “Capitulation on the Reduction of New Netherland,
subscribed at the Governor’s Bouwery, August 27, O. S., 1664,” insured the careful preservation
of the archives of the Dutch government by the English conquerors. In June,
1688, they were still in the Secretary’s office at New York; a few months later “Edward
Randolph, then Secretary of ye Dominion of New England, carried away [to Boston] ye
severall Bookes before Exprest,” says a Report of commissioners appointed by the Committee
of Safety of New York to examine the books, etc., in the Secretary’s office, dated
Sept. 23, 1689. Why he carried them off, the minutes of the proceedings against Leisler
would probably disclose, if found. They remained in Boston until 1691, when Governor
Sloughter, of New York, had them brought back. Comparing the inventory of June, 1688
(which states that there were found in “Presse no. 3 a parcell of old Dutch Records and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
bundles of Papers, all Being marked and numbred as y<sup>ey</sup> Lay now in the said presse,”<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a>
which, to judge from the number of books in the other presses, must have been large)
with an inventory and examination of the Dutch records made in June, 1753, under the
supervision of the commissioners appointed by an act of the General Assembly to examine
the eastern boundaries of the province, I come to the conclusion that the missing Dutch
and English records were lost either in their wanderings between New York and Boston,
or during the brief Dutch interregnum of 1673-74,<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a> or perhaps in the fire which consumed
Fort George in New York on the 18th of April, 1741, although Governor Clarke informs the
Board of Trade that “most of the records were saved and I hope very few lost, for I took
all the possible care of them, and had all removed before the office took fire.”</p>

<p>The inventory
of 1753 shows that up to the present day nothing has since been lost, with the exception
of a missing account-book and of some things which time has made illegible and of others
which the knife of the autograph-hunter has cut out. It is difficult to say how much has gone
through the latter unscrupulous method into the hands of private parties. The catalogues
of collections of autographs sold at auction occasionally show papers which seem to have
belonged to the State archives, but it is impossible to prove that they came thence. An
examination, hurriedly made a few years ago, of the 103 volumes of Colonial Manuscripts
of New York, showed that about three hundred documents had been stolen since Dr.
O’Callaghan published in 1866 the <i>Calendar</i><a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a> of these manuscripts. The then Secretary
of State, Mr. John Bigelow, published the list of missing documents, calling upon the
parties in possession of any of them to return the property of the State; and a month
later he had the gratification of receiving a package containing about sixty, of which,
however, only twenty were mentioned in the published list, while the loss of the others
had not then been discovered. A thorough examination would probably bring the number
of missing or mutilated papers to nearly one thousand. It is equally remarkable and fortunate,
that during the war of the Revolution the records became an object of solicitude
both to the royal Governor and the Provincial Congress.</p>

<p>The latter, fearing that the destruction
of the records would “unhinge the property of numbers in the colony, and
throw all legal proceedings into the most fatal confusion,” requested, Sept. 2, 1775, Secretary
Bayard, whose ancestor, Nicolas Bayard, also had them in charge when the English
retook New York in 1674, to deposit them in some safe place. Bayard, struggling between
his duties as a royal officer and his sympathies as a born American, hesitated to take the
papers in his charge from the place appointed for their keeping, but packed them nevertheless
in boxes to be ready for immediate removal. Sears’s <i>coup de main</i> in November,
1775, and the intimation that he intended speedily to return with a larger body of “Connecticut
Rioters” to take away the records of the province, induced Governor Tryon to
remove “such public records as were most interesting to the Crown” on board of the
“Dutchess of Gordon” man-of-war, to which he himself had fled for safety. When
called upon, Feb. 7, 1776, by order of the Provincial Congress, to surrender them, he
offered to place them on board a vessel, specially to be chartered for that purpose,
which was to remain in the harbor. He pledged his honor that they should not be injured
by the King’s forces, but refused to land them anywhere, because they could not
be taken to a place safer than where they were. “Shortly afterwards,” he writes to
Lord Germain in March, 1779, “the public records were for greater security (the Rebels
threatening to board in the night and take the vessel) put on board the ‘Asia,’ under the
care of Captain Vandeput. The ‘Asia’ being ordered home soon after the taking of New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
York, Captain Vandeput desired me to inform him what he should do with the two boxes
of public records. I recommended them to be placed on board the ‘Eagle’ man-of-war.”
The records not “most interesting to the Crown” (most likely including the Dutch records)
were taken with Secretary Bayard to his father’s house in the “Out Ward of New York,”
where a detachment of forty-eight men of the First New York City Regiment, later of
Captain Alexander Hamilton’s Artillery Company, was detailed to guard them. In June
of the same year, 1776, they were removed to the seat of government at Kingston, N. Y.
Almost a year later two hundred men were raised for the special duty of guarding them,
and when the enemy approached Kingston this body conveyed them to a small place in
the interior (Rochester, Ulster County), whence they were returned to Kingston in November,
1777. From that date they followed the legislature and executive offices to New York
in 1783, and finally in 1798 to Albany, where they have since remained. In New York the
records which were carried off by Governor Tryon, and had been in the mean time transferred
from the “Eagle” to the “Warwick” man-of-war and then returned to the city in
1781, were again placed with the others. At the instance of the New York Historical
Society, the Dutch part of the State records were ordered to be translated; and this duty
was entrusted by Governor De Witt Clinton to Dr. Francis A. van der Kemp, a learned
Hollander, whom the political dissensions in the latter quarter of the eighteenth century
had driven from his home. Unfortunately, Dr. van der Kemp’s knowledge of the English
tongue was not quite equal to the task; nor was his eyesight, as he himself confesses in a
marginal note to a passage dimmed by age, strong enough to decipher such papers as had
suffered from the ravages of time and become almost illegible. This translation, completed
in 1822, is therefore in many instances incorrect and incomplete; grave mistakes have been
the consequence, much to the annoyance of historical students. Some of the errors
were corrected by Dr. E. B. O’Callaghan, who published in 1849-54, under the authority
of the State, four volumes of <i>Documents relating to the History of the Colony</i> (1604-1799),
selected at random from the copies procured abroad, from the State archives, and from
other sources. In 1876 the Hon. John Bigelow, Secretary of State, directed the writer of
this paper to translate and prepare a volume of documents relating to the Delaware colony,
which was published in 1877; another volume, containing the records of the early settlements
in the Hudson and Mohawk River valleys, translated by the writer, followed in
1881; this year will see a third, on the settlements on Long Island; and a fourth, to be
published later, will contain the documents relating to New York city and the relations
between the Dutch and the neighboring English colonies. These four volumes contain
everything of a general and public interest, so that the parts not translated anew will
refer only to personal matters.</p>

<p>These being the official sources of information for the history of New Netherland, it
is proper to inquire whether they are trustworthy beyond doubt. The charge made by
Robert Thorne, of Bristol, in 1527<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a> against the “Portingals,” of having “falsified their
records of late purposely,” might be repeated against the Dutch wherever the claim of
first discovery of the country is discussed.</p>

<p>I have already stated that one of the motives, and perhaps the principal one, for establishing
the West India Company was of a political nature. The destruction of Spain’s
financial resources was to lead to an honorable and satisfactory peace with Holland.
Spain relied for the sinews of war on its American colonies; and we must inquire how
much of the information relating to location and extent of these colonies had reached the
Dutch notwithstanding the Spanish efforts to suppress it.</p>

<p>Hakluyt says:<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a> “The first discovery of these coasts (never heard of before) was well
begun by John Cabot and Sebastian his son, who were the first finders out of all that great
tract of land stretching from the Cape of Florida unto those Islands which we now call
the Newfoundland, or which they brought and annexed to the Crown of England [1497].”</p>

<p class="pf400">The map, which is described more fully in
another volume, has been the theme of much
controversy, it being usually held to be the result
of Gomez’s explorations; but this is denied by
Stevens. References upon it by the Editor will
be found in the Ticknor <i>Catalogue</i>, published by
the Boston Public Library. It is of interest in
the present connection as being one of the current
charts of the coast, though made eighty years
earlier, which Hudson could and did take with
him. How he interpreted it is not known. In
our day there is much diverse opinion upon its
points. Mr. Murphy, for instance, in his <i>Voyage
of Verrazzano</i>, puts the Hudson River at 5, and
Cape Cod at 10. Sprengel, who published a
memoir on this map in 1795, thought Hudson’s
river was the one between 10 and 11. Asher,
in his <i>Henry Hudson</i>, p. xciii, takes the same
view. Kohl, in his <i>Discovery of Maine</i>, p. 304,
and in his <i>Die beiden ältesten General-Karten von
America</i>, p. 43, makes the river between 10 and
11 the Penobscot, and the hook near 2 Cape
Cod, though he acknowledges some objections
to this interpretation of the latter landmark,
because the names between 2 and 8 are those
that in later maps are given to the New Netherland
coast. It seems to the Editor, however,
as it does to Kohl, that Ribero had fallen into
a confusion of misplacing names, common to
early map-makers, and that we cannot keep the
names right and accept the strange geographical
correspondences which, for instance, Dr. De
Costa imposes on the map in his <i>Verrazano
the Explorer</i>, when he makes the hook near 2
to be Sandy Hook, at New York Bay, and the
bay between 10 and 11 the Penobscot, which he
thinks “clearly defined,” while “Ribero gives
no hint of the region now embraced by Long
Island, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts.”
It is difficult to accept Dr. De Costa’s
“wildly exaggerated” Sandy Hook, or his
notion of “Dr. Kohl’s confusion” in regarding
the great gulf of these early maps, shown between
2 and 10, as the Gulf of Maine. With all
the difficulties attending Kohl’s interpretation,
it presents fewer anomalies than any other.
There is so much uncertainty at the best in the
interpretation of these early maps, that any understanding
is subject to change from the developments
now making in the study of this early
cartography.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p>I will not assert that the Cabots actually saw and explored the whole coast from Florida
to Newfoundland, but they must have brought away the impression that the land seen by
them was a continent, and that no passage to the East Indies could be found
in these latitudes, but should be looked for farther north. A map in the
collection of the General Staff of the Army at Munich;<a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a> supposed to have been
made by Salvatore de Pilestrina about 1517, shows that the cartographers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
that period had accepted this Cabot theory as a fact. The voyage of Esteban Gomez in
1524, sent out “to find a way to Cathay” between Florida and the Baccalaos,<a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a> resulted
only in discovering “mucha tierra, continuada con la que se llama de los Baccalaos, discurriendo
al <i>Occidente y puesta en XL. grados y XLI</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a></p>

<p>The next voyage along the coast of North America, made in 1526 by Lucas Vasquez
de Aillon and Matienzo, must be considered of importance for the cartography of the first
half of the sixteenth century; for their discoveries, although of no direct benefit to them
or to Spain, proved to Spanish map-makers and their imitators that North America was
not, like the West Indies, an archipelago of islands, but a continent. Even though Ramusio,
in the preface to vol. iii. of his work, published in 1556, declares it is not yet
known whether New France is connected with Florida or is an island, the maps made
shortly after Aillon’s voyage<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a> show that the cartographers had decided the matter in
<i>their</i> minds.</p>

<p>This knowledge was not confined to the map-makers and officials, who might have been
forbidden to divulge such information. A contemporary writer says, in 1575:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“La forme donc de la Floride est en peninsule et come triangulaire, ayant la mer qui la baigne
de tous costez sauf vers le Septentrion.... Au Septentrion luy sont Hochelaga [Canada] et autres
terres.... Or ce pays Floridien commence à la grande rivière, que les mondernes ont appelé de
St. Jean [Cape Fear River?], qui le separe du pays de Norumbeg en la nouvelle France.”<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a></p>

<p class="p1">And I refer further to the divers <i>Descriptiones Ptolemaicæ</i><a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a> published during the sixteenth
century,&mdash;books accessible to the public of that day, and most likely known to
and read by every navigator of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>To bring this information still nearer home to Henry Hudson, I mention the map made
by Thomas Hood, an Englishman, in 1592,<a name="FNanchor_800_800" id="FNanchor_800_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a> and the work of Peter Plancius, published
in 1594.<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a> Hudson, an English navigator, could hardly have been ignorant of his countryman’s
production, which shows under 40° north latitude the mouth of a river called Rio
de San Antonio, the name given to Hudson’s River by the earlier Spanish discoverers.
Before starting on his voyage in the “Half Moon,” Hudson had been in consultation with
Dr. Peter Plancius, who adds to his chapter on “Norumberga et Virginia” a map, incorrect,
it is true, as to latitudes and other details, but nevertheless showing an unbroken
coast-line.</p>

<p>When, therefore, it is stated that Hudson abandoned the plan of seeking for
a northeast passage, in the hope of finding, under 40° north latitude, a passage to the
Western Ocean, as advised by his friends Captain John Smith, of Virginia, and Dr.
Plancius, we are asked to accept as true a statement made and spread about for political
purposes. These will be understood when we recall the motives for the establishment
of the West India Company,&mdash;a project in which Plancius, a minister of the Reformed
Church, and as such driven from his Belgian home by the Spaniards, gave his hearty
and active co-operation to Usselinx. International law gave possession for his sovereign
to any one who discovered a new land not formerly claimed by any Christian prince or
inhabited by any Christian nation. To have a base for their operations in America against
Spain, Holland required territory not so claimed, and the shrewd projectors undoubtedly
deemed it most advisable to establish this base not only in an unclaimed but also in a hitherto
unknown country. Therefore it was necessary to claim for Hudson the discovery of
the river bearing his name, as the West India Company did in 1634,<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a> although a few years
before, in 1632, they had admitted by inference<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> that Hudson’s River was known to other
nations under the name of Rio de Montañas, and of Rio de Montaigne, before Hudson
saw it.<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a> In the following decade the statement of 1634 was forgotten, and the company in
1644 claimed title by the first discovery of the Hudson and Delaware rivers, through ships
of the Greenland Company in 1598.<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a> Still later, in 1659, by the mouth of their diplomatic
agents in Maryland and Virginia, it is asserted that Holland derived its title to New Netherland
through Spain as “first discoverer and founder of that New World,” and through
the French, who, by one Jehan de Verrazano<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a> a Florentine, were in 1524 the second followers
and discoverers in the northern parts of America.<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a> Falsification in politics was
evidently then, as it is now, a venial sin; the statements made for political purposes,
although emanating from official sources, must, therefore, be accepted with due caution.<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span></p>

<p>As the history of New Netherland is closely connected with that of the West India
Company, and as the West India Company was one of the great political factors in the
United Provinces, the Dutch State-Papers<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> and the writings of contemporaneous authors<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a>
must be duly considered by the student of this period of our history.</p>

<p>Most prominent among contemporaneous writers is Willem Usselinx, the originator of
the Dutch West India and Swedish South Companies, even though his writings have not
always a direct bearing upon the history of New Netherland. We know little of the life
of this remarkable man, beyond the facts that he was a native of Belgium and a merchant
at Antwerp, whom the political and religious troubles of the period had compelled to leave
his fatherland and to seek refuge in Holland; that, inspired by hatred against Spain, he
conceived the plan of the West India Company; that for some unexplained reason the
West India Company lost his services, which were then, about 1626, offered to King Gustavus
Adolphus of Sweden in the establishment of the South Company.<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a> As Usselinx
chiefly wrote before the West India Company was organized, and as its advocate, his books
and pamphlets, instead of being historical, are of a more or less polemical character.
He never forgets what he had to suffer through Spain, and points out constantly how important
to Holland is the commerce of the West Indies, and that in their peace negotiations
with Spain the States-General must by all means preserve the freedom of trading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
to America. These writings date from before Hudson’s voyage in 1609, and Usselinx
disappears from the list of writers after the publication of the patent granted by Sweden
to the South Company in 1627, unless we admit the above-quoted <i>West-Indische Spieghel</i>
to be his work. Asher, in his <i>Bibliographical Essay</i>, gives as the latest of his works the
<i>Argonautica Gustaviana</i>,<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a> and had evidently no knowledge of the <i>Advice to Establish a
new South Company</i>, written by Usselinx in 1636.</p>

</div>

<p>The next writer to be considered had exceptional facilities in gathering his material.
As director of the West India Company, Johannes de Laet<a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a> had of course ready access
to the records, while as co-patroon
of Rensselaerswyck
he had an especial interest
in the country where his
daughter and son-in-law<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a>
had made their home. Two
manuscript volumes in folio,
written by De Laet himself,
and now in the collection of
Mr. J. Carson Brevoort, give us an idea of the painstaking diligence with which De Laet
collected the matter of the books which he intended to write. These two volumes contain
no material relating specially to New Netherland, but he made undoubtedly as extensive
preparations for the chapter on the Dutch colony in North America in his <i>Nieuwe Wereld</i>,<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a>
as he had made for the others, by copying from the most authentic works on the subject, by
talking with seafarers returned from the transatlantic colony, and by transcribing letters
from private persons residing there. His intention to give to his fellow-citizens as perfect a
description of the New World as circumstances would allow, was carefully carried out. It
would have been difficult to produce anything better at the time when he wrote; and we
must accept this book as the standard work on New Netherland of the seventeenth century,
even though he makes in the book, as well as on its accompanying map, a few slight errors;
saying, for instance, that “Manhattan Island is separated from the mainland by the Hellgate,”
or that “Fort Orange stood [at the time of his writing, 1625] on an island close to
the left [western] shore of [Hudson’s] river.”</p>

<p>The title of De Laet’s next work<a name="FNanchor_816_816" id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a> is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
misleading, for one would naturally expect to find the history of the first settlement on
the soil of New York in all its details;<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a> but the name of New Netherland is only mentioned,
as it were, by accident. Still the book has its value for the student of the philosophy
of American history, for in the preface the author frankly admits that the object of
the West India Company was war on Spain, and he congratulates the country upon the
successes so far obtained; and he further shows how the Company, organized for warlike
purposes, could not give any attention to a country which, under the circumstances, required
the utmost care for its profitable development. Considering that De Laet was
personally interested in New Netherland as co-patroon of Rensselaerswyck and through
the marriage of his daughter to an inhabitant of the province, it is astonishing to find so
little said by him of the actual occurrences there. It may be that reasons of policy and
prudence restrained him from baring to the public eye many things for which the Company
could be called to account. The new race, however, with which his countrymen had come
in contact, had sufficiently excited his interest to induce him to study their habits and
speculate upon their origin, so that when the learned Grotius published a treatise on
the American Indians,<a name="FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a> De Laet rushed into the field combating Grotius’s theories.</p>

<p>While De Laet reports the events in New Netherland up to a given date as a member
of the Government saw them, we have two authors before whose eyes some of these
events took place, and who in writing about them criticise them in the manner of subjects
and citizens. To the first of these, David Pietersen de Vries, <i>Artillerie-Meester
van d’ Noorder Quartier</i>, Mr. Bancroft gives the credit of being the founder of the
State of Delaware.<a name="FNanchor_819_819" id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a> How far the abortive attempt of establishing the colony of Zwanendael,
mentioned in the narrative, and the voyage bringing over the colonists may be
called “the cradling of a state,” I leave others to decide. De Vries published in 1655
an account of his voyages<a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a> made twenty years before, and tells us in his book, in the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
unvarnished manner and with the bluntness of a sailor, how badly New Netherland was
being governed under the administration of Minuit and Van Twiller. No doubt as to the
veracity of his statements can be entertained, as in his case there could be no motive for
“divagation.” He views the loss of his Delaware colony with the proverbial equanimity
both of a Dutchman and of a sailor, and stands so far above the coarseness of manners
and life in his time, that he considers officials addicted to drink not much better than criminals.
Where he speaks of matters not seen by himself, and of the Indians and their mode
of life, he follows closely the best authority to be found; namely, the work of Domine
Johannis Megapolensis.</p>

<p>The other author, Jonker<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a> Adrian van der Donck, Doctor of Laws and Advocate of
the Supreme Court of Holland, has done more to give to his contemporaries a full knowledge
of the country of his adoption, and to implant in the country itself better institutions,
than any other man. Sent over in 1642 as Schout (sheriff) of the Patroons’ Colony of
Rensselaerswyck, he in 1647 left this service in consequence of a quarrel with the vice-director,
and purchased from the Indians the colony of Colen Donck, now Yonkers, for
which he received a patent in 1648.<a name="FNanchor_822_822" id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a> A controversy arose about this time between the
Government and several colonists, among whom was Van der Donck, which led to a
remonstrance being drawn up, to be laid before the States-General for a redress of certain
grievances which they had so far failed to obtain either from the provincial governor or
the West India Company.<a name="FNanchor_823_823" id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a> It is a contemporaneous relation of events in New Netherland
signed by eleven residents of New Amsterdam. Its probable author was Van der Donck;
at least his original journal was the source from which this “Remonstrance” was derived.
The form in which Governor Stuyvesant seized it<a name="FNanchor_824_824" id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a> is, however, different from the one in
which it was published. In the latter it is divided in three parts: 1. A description of the
natives and of the physical features of the country; 2. Events connected with the earliest
settlements of the country; 3. Remonstrance against the policy of the West India<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
Company. The tone and character of such a document must be necessarily aggressive;
but, even though the reply to it by the provincial secretary, Van Tienhoven,<a name="FNanchor_825_825" id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a> denies most
of its allegations, it certainly contains valuable and trustworthy information.</p>

<p>Van der Donck’s next work, acknowledged by him as his own,<a name="FNanchor_826_826" id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a> is an improvement on
De Laet’s similar description. The time which had elapsed since De Laet’s publication
had taught different lessons, and Van der Donck’s personal experience in the country described
by him could not fail to give him a better insight than even the best written reports
afforded to De Laet. But, with the latter, this author falls into the error of ascribing to
the Indians a statement that the Dutch were the first white people seen by them, and that
they did not know there were any other people in the world. This assertion is contradicted
by the Long Island Indians, who talked with a later traveller, telling him that “the first
strangers seen in these parts were Spaniards or Portuguese, who did not remain long, and
afterwards the Dutch came.”<a name="FNanchor_827_827" id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a> The so-called “Pompey Stone,” in the State Geological
Museum, might be taken for another contradiction of De Laet’s and Van der Donck’s
statements. Still more apparently contradictory evidence might be the similarity of some
so-called Indian words with words of the Latin tongues.<a name="FNanchor_828_828" id="FNanchor_828_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a> Nor is Van der Donck correct
in the relation of the discovery of the country by Hudson, and the map accompanying his
work has several grave errors. The description of the physical features of the country,
of the animals, and of the Indians is followed by a discourse between a patriot and a New
Netherlander on the conveniences of the new colony, in which the questions are asked and
answered, whether it is to the advantage of Holland to have such a flourishing colony, and
whether this colony will ever be able to defend itself against foreign enemies.</p>

<p>Another resident of New Netherland, the Reverend Johannis Megapolensis (van Mekelenburg),
one of the few educated men who came to this country at that early date, has
given us a book which, though not strictly
referring to the history of the country,
must yet be considered as one of the collateral
sources, and finds its most appropriate
place here, following the <i>Descriptions</i>. As minister of the Reformed Church at
Rensselaerswyck, whither he was called by the patroon in 1642, he came soon in close
contact with the Indians; and having learned the difficult Mohawk language, he became,
several years earlier than the New England preacher, John Eliot, a missionary among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
the Indians. The result of his labors was an account of the Mohawks, their country, etc.<a name="FNanchor_829_829" id="FNanchor_829_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a>
This account was closely followed by De Vries, as mentioned above, and by most of the
other writers on the Indians.</p>

<div class="floatright">
     <img src="images/ill-421.jpg" width="200" height="121" id="i421"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>A large share of
the material for this work Megapolensis must
have received from Father Jogues, a Jesuit missionary
whom the Dominie rescued from captivity
among the Mohawks. The letters of this
courageous and zealous servant of the Church
to his superiors teem with information concerning
the Indians, whom he endeavored to Christianize,<a name="FNanchor_830_830" id="FNanchor_830_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a>
and at whose hands he died.</p>

<p>Either the financial success of De Laet’s works, whose copyright had in the mean time
expired, or else the interest in New Netherland affairs which had been newly aroused by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
presentation to, and discussion before, the States-General of the <i>Vertoogh</i>, led to the compilation
in 1651<a name="FNanchor_831_831" id="FNanchor_831_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a> of a book on New Netherland by Joost Hartgers, a bookseller of Amsterdam,
which is nothing more than a clever arrangement of extracts from De Laet’s
<i>Description</i>, second edition, the <i>Vertoogh</i>, and Megapolensis’ Indian treatise. Of much
greater importance and value to the historical student is an anonymous publication of 1659,
the title of which gives no idea of its real contents. Like most popularly written works of
the day discussing topics of public interest, it is in the form of a conversation between a
countryman, a citizen, and a sailor, who discuss the deplorable depression of commerce,
navigation, trade, and agriculture in Holland, and speculate on the best means to improve
this state of affairs.<a name="FNanchor_832_832" id="FNanchor_832_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a> The author speaks of New Netherland matters with a positiveness
which puts it beyond a doubt that he had been in that country.<a name="FNanchor_833_833" id="FNanchor_833_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a> Only a few pages are
given to the description of New Netherland, but the propositions advanced on colonization,
self-government of colonies, free-trade, and slavery are all aimed at the West India Company
and its American territories. These propositions are of such a broad and liberal
character, that they would do credit to any writer of our more enlightened times. A
similar feeling of hostility against the West India Company and New Netherland, both
then (1659) in a condition to invite criticism, pervades the work of Otto Keye,<a name="FNanchor_834_834" id="FNanchor_834_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a> who advocates
the colonization of Guiana as being more rational and profitable than that of New
Netherland. Starting with the argument that a warm climate is preferable to a colder one,
on account both of physical comforts and of greater commercial advantages, he gives a
description of the two countries, the bias being of course in favor of Guiana.</p>

<p>The most remarkable of all the contemporary Dutch books appeared also anonymously
in 1662.<a name="FNanchor_835_835" id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a> The description of the country given in this work adds nothing new to our store<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
of information, and the book itself has therefore been ranked by American historians with
such compilations as the works of Montanus, Melton, and others, who simply reprinted
De Laet, Van der Donck, etc. It is, however, of great value, for through it we obtain an
insight into the Dutch politics of the day, which had so far-reaching an influence on the
history of New Netherland and on its colonization. The fight between the Gomarian
(Orangist) and the Arminian<a name="FNanchor_836_836" id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a> (Liberal) parties, which had so long prevented the first
organization of the West India Company, had never been settled and was now revived.
The De Witts, as leaders of the Arminians, were as much opposed to this organization as
Oldenbarnevelt had been. Whether the ulterior loss of New Netherland, to which this
opposition finally led, embarrassed them as much as is stated<a name="FNanchor_837_837" id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a> or not, it was certainly at
this time (1662) in the programme of the Arminian party to destroy the West India Company,
and by reforming the government of New Netherland build up the country. This
seems to have been the motive for writing the <i>Kort Verhael</i>, which, according to Asher,<a name="FNanchor_838_838" id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a>
was written by a journalist, opposing the third ultra-radical and the Orangist parties, in
conjunction with a Mennonist. It will be remembered that in 1656-1657 part of the
South River (Delaware) territory had been surrendered, for financial reasons, to the
authorities of Amsterdam, and had ceased to be in the jurisdiction of the Governor-General
of New Netherland. The plan<a name="FNanchor_839_839" id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a> submitted to the burgomasters in the Requests
and Representations, etc., aimed at a further curtailing of the Company’s territory in that
region by planting there a colony of Mennonists, with the most liberal self-government, under
the supreme jurisdiction of the city of Amsterdam; while the vehemence with which
Otto Keye and his work favoring Guiana at the expense of New Netherland are attacked
shows that the Anti-Orangists, though bent upon ruining one of the principal factors
of the Orange party, were by no means inclined to give up New Netherland as a colony.
A work from which copious extracts are given in the <i>Kort Verhael</i>, and called <i>Zeker
Nieuw-Nederlants geschrift</i>,&mdash;“A Certain New Netherland Writing,”&mdash;seems to be lost
to us; also a work, <i>Noort Revier</i>,&mdash;“North River,”&mdash;mentioned by Van der Donck.</p>


<p>The works of Montanus,<a name="FNanchor_840_840" id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a> Melton,<a name="FNanchor_841_841" id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a> and a few others<a name="FNanchor_842_842" id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a> deserve no more mention than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
by title, as being compilations of extracts from books already referred to; and with these
closes the list of such contemporary and almost contemporary Dutch works on New
Netherland as are either purely descriptive or both descriptive and historical.</p>

<p>Of the contemporary Dutch works of purely historical character, not one treats of New
Netherland alone; but the Dutch historians of the time could not well write of the <i>res
gestæ</i> of their nation without referring to what they had done on the other side of the
Atlantic. The first of them in point of time, Emanuel van Meteren,<a name="FNanchor_843_843" id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a> gives us in his
<i>Historie van de Oorlogen en Geschiedenissen der Nederlanderen</i>,<a name="FNanchor_844_844" id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a> a minute description of
the discoveries made by Hudson, and must be specially consulted for the history of the
origin of the West India Company. Although credulous to such an extent that the value
of his painstaking labors is frequently endangered by the gross errors caused by his
credulity, he had no chance of committing mistakes where, as in the case of the West
India Company, everything was official. His information regarding Hudson’s voyage of
1609, we may assume, was derived from Hudson himself on his return to England, where
Van Meteren lived as merchant and Dutch consul until 1612, the year of his death.</p>

<p>The next Dutch historian whose work is one of our sources, Nicolas Jean de Wassenaer,<a name="FNanchor_845_845" id="FNanchor_845_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a>
takes us a step farther; but he too fails to give us much more than a record of
the earliest years of the existence of the West India Company. His account of how
this Company came to be organized differs somewhat as to the motives from all others.<a name="FNanchor_846_846" id="FNanchor_846_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a></p>

<p>With the works of Aitzema,<a name="FNanchor_847_847" id="FNanchor_847_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a> <i>Saken van Staat en Oorlogh in ende omtrent de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
Vereenigde Nederlanden</i>, 1621-1669, and <i>Herstelde Leeuw</i>, 1650,<a name="FNanchor_848_848" id="FNanchor_848_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a> and with Costerus’s
<i>Historisch Verhael</i>, 1572-1673, we come to the end of the list of Dutch historians giving
us information of the events in New Netherland. But I cannot allow the reader to take
leave of these Dutch books without a few words concerning the first book printed which
treated of New Netherland. The <i>Breeden Raedt aende Vereenichde Nederlandsche Provintien
... gemaeckt ende gestelt uijt diverse ... memorien door I. A. G. W. C.</i>, Antwerpen,
1649,<a name="FNanchor_849_849" id="FNanchor_849_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a> is neither purely historical nor descriptive, but its polemic character requires
such constant allusion both to the events in, and to the geography of, New Netherland,
that we must class it among the most important sources for our history. Its authorship
is unknown, and has been subject to many surmises.</p>

<p>It may cause astonishment that the writers of Holland, a country then renowned for
its learning, should not have thought it worth their while to write a history of their transatlantic
colonies. But we must bear in mind, first, that the settlement of New Netherland
was neither a governmental nor a popular undertaking; second, that in the beginning
the West India Company had no intention of making it a colony, and that the people, who
came here under the first governors as the Company’s servants, and also those who later
came as freeholders, were hardly educated enough, even if they had not been too busy with
their own affairs, to pay much attention to, or write of, public matters. The few educated
men were officers of the Company, and did not care to lose their places by speaking with
too much frankness of what was going on. Whatever they desired to publish they had
to submit to the directors of the Company, and it is not likely that any unpleasant information
would have passed the censor. Third, the Company did not desire any information
whatever concerning New Netherland, except what they thought fit, to be given to the
public,<a name="FNanchor_850_850" id="FNanchor_850_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a>&mdash;hence the obstacles which prevented Adrian Van der Donck from writing the
history of New Netherland in addition to his <i>Description</i>,<a name="FNanchor_851_851" id="FNanchor_851_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a> and the scanty information
which the contemporary historian has to give us.</p>

<p>Subsequent Dutch writers found a good deal to say about the Dutch colonies on the
Hudson and Delaware rivers. The most trustworthy among them is Jean Wagenaar,<a name="FNanchor_852_852" id="FNanchor_852_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a> who,
beginning life as a merchant’s clerk, felt a strong desire for acquiring fame as an author.
He studied languages and history, and at last wholly devoted himself to Dutch history.
His <i>Vaderlandsche Historie</i> is held in Holland to be the best historical work written,
although his political bias as an opponent of the House of Orange is evident. Wagenaar
is, however, more an annalist than a historian. As official historiographer, and later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
Secretary of the City of Amsterdam, he had free access to the archives; hence his statements
are not to be discredited. His account of the circumstances under which Hudson
was sent out in 1609 differs materially from all other writers. “The Company,” he says,
“sent out a skipper to discover a passage to China by the <i>northwest</i>, not by the northeast.”
A resolution of the States of Holland, quoted by Wagenaar, proves that previous
to Hudson’s voyage the Dutch knew that they would find <i>terra firma</i> north of the Spanish
possessions, and contiguous to them.<a name="FNanchor_853_853" id="FNanchor_853_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a></p>

<p>The scantiness of information concerning New Netherland in Dutch books explains
why we can learn still less from the writings of other nations; for sectional or national
feeling caused either a complete silence on colonial affairs, or incorrect and contradictory
statements, leading many to rely on hearsay, unsupported by records.</p>

<p>Among the earliest works (not in Dutch) speaking of New Netherland, we have the work
of Levinus Hulsius (Hulse), a native of Ghent, distinguished for his learning, and after him
his sons, who published, at Nürnberg, Frankfort, and Oppenheim, a <i>Sammlung von 26
Schiffahrten in verschieden fremde Landen</i>,&mdash;“Collection of twenty-six Voyages in many
Foreign Countries,”&mdash;between the years 1598 and 1650; the twelfth part of this work
chronicles the attempts of the English and Dutch to discover a passage by way of the North
Pole, and includes Hudson’s voyage.<a name="FNanchor_854_854" id="FNanchor_854_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a> The twentieth part refers likewise to voyages to
this continent, and specially to our coast. Other German works of this early period can
only be mentioned by their title, because for the above reasons they are not sufficiently
correct to be considered trustworthy sources of information.<a name="FNanchor_855_855" id="FNanchor_855_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a> Their titles show them to
be not much more than “hackwork,” with little value to the contemporary or any later
reader. But when we find that a celebrated geographer of the time, Philipp Cluvier (born
at Dantzic, 1580, died 1623), omits all mention of the existence of such countries as New
England and New Netherland, we can well understand how difficult it must have been to
gather material for a universal geography.<a name="FNanchor_856_856" id="FNanchor_856_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a> Later editors of the same work, writing in
1697, had then apparently only just learned that up to 1665 a part of North America was
called Novum Belgium. Hardly less ignorant, though he mentions Virginia and Canada
in describing the bounds of Florida, is Gottfriedt in his <i>Neuwe Archontologia Cosmica</i>,
Frankfort, 1638; yet he too was a distinguished geographer.<a name="FNanchor_857_857" id="FNanchor_857_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a></p>

<p>Turning to the English, we find a few credible and a great many very fantastic and unreliable
writers, treating either specially or incidentally of New Netherland. The first mention
of the Dutch on the Hudson is made in a little work, republished in the <i>Collections</i> of
the Massachusetts Historical Society,<a name="FNanchor_858_858" id="FNanchor_858_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a> in which it is stated that an English sea-captain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
Dermer, “met on his passage [from Virginia to New England] with certain Hollanders who
had a trade in Hudson’s River some years before that time (1619).” This is probably the
first application of Hudson’s name to the river. In a letter<a name="FNanchor_859_859" id="FNanchor_859_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a> from the same traveller, dated
at a plantation in Virginia, December, 1619, he describes his passage through Hellgate and
Long Island Sound, but does not say anything about the settlement on Manhattan Island.</p>

<p>This letter of Dermer and the <i>Brief Relation</i> first informed the English that “the
Hollanders as interlopers had fallen into ye middle betwixt the plantations” of Virginia
and New England.<a name="FNanchor_860_860" id="FNanchor_860_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a> The <i>Description of the Province of New Albion</i><a name="FNanchor_861_861" id="FNanchor_861_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a> informs us that
“Capt. Samuel Argal and Thomas Dale on their return [from Canada in 1613] landed at
Manhatas Isle in Hudson’s River, where they found four houses built, and a pretended
Dutch governor under the West India Company’s of Amsterdam share or part, who kept
trading-boats and trucking with the Indians;” but the official correspondence<a name="FNanchor_862_862" id="FNanchor_862_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a> between
the authorities of Virginia and the Home Government proves that Argal and his party
never went to New Netherland, although they intended to do so in 1621; for, hearing that
the Dutch had settled on the Hudson, a “demurre in their p<sup>r</sup>ceding was caused.”<a name="FNanchor_863_863" id="FNanchor_863_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a> The
motive for making the above-quoted statement concerning Argal’s visit in 1613 is apparent.
The imposing pseudonym under which the <i>Description of New Albion</i> appeared was
probably assumed by Sir Edmund Ploeyden (Plowden), to whom in 1634 Lord Strafford,
then viceroy of Ireland, had granted the patent of New Albion<a name="FNanchor_864_864" id="FNanchor_864_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a> covering the Dutch possession,
and who therefore had an obvious interest adverse to the Dutch title. Its publication
at the time, when the right of the Dutch to the country was being discussed
between England and the States-General of Holland, was intended to influence the
British mind. It contains a queer jumble of fact and fancy, and it is not necessary to
say more about its claims to be an historical authority than has already been published

<p>Considering that, according to Van der Donck, Sir Edmund Ploeyden had been in
New Netherland several times, it seems almost incredible that he should have made such
astonishing statements, if he was the author of the book. A perusal of a work published
a few years previous to the <i>Description of New Albion</i> would have set him right, at least
so far as the geography of the country was concerned.<a name="FNanchor_866_866" id="FNanchor_866_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a> The author of the <i>Short Discovery</i>
has very correct notions of the hydrography of New Netherland, acquired apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
by the study of Dutch maps; but the distances and degrees of latitude are as great a
puzzle to him as to many other geographers and seamen of that day. As he wrote before
the Dutch title to New Netherland was disputed, he is of course silent concerning the
English claims to the territory.</p>

<p>The historian writing of New Netherland to-day has the advantage of being able to
consult the journal of a governor of Massachusetts, John Winthrop, who took an active
part in the occurrences which he describes.<a name="FNanchor_867_867" id="FNanchor_867_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a> Although it does not cover the whole of the
Dutch period of New York, and his puritanical bias is occasionally evident, we have no
more reliable source for the history of the relations between the colonies.</p>

<p>The few historical data given in the next book to be considered<a name="FNanchor_868_868" id="FNanchor_868_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a> are of interest, as the
author endeavors to “assert the rights of the English nation in vouching the legal interest
of England in right of the first discovery or premier seizure to Novum Belgium.” They
show, however, also how in so short a period as a man’s life even contemporary history can
be distorted. According to Heylin, who takes Sir Samuel Argal as his source, Hudson
had been commissioned by King James I. to make the voyage of 1609, and after making
his discoveries sold his maps and charts to the Dutch. The Dutch were willing to surrender
their claims to Sir Edmund Ploeyden, he says, for £2,500, but took advantage of
the troubles in England, and, instead of surrendering, armed the Indians to help them in
resisting any English attempt to reduce New Netherland. Leaving aside Plantagenet’s
<i>New Albion</i>, we meet here, in a work which the author’s high reputation must immediately
have placed among the standard works of the day, a most startling falsification of facts
and events which had occurred during the lifetime of the author. It is impossible to
account for it, even if we suppose that these statements were made for political effect; for
the men who read Heylin’s book had also read the correct accounts of Hudson’s voyages,
and knew that Heylin’s statements were false. The learned prelate is only little less at
fault in his geographical account. Although he tells us that Hudson gave his name to one
of the rivers, he mentions as the two principal ones only the <i>Manhates</i> or <i>Nassau</i> or <i>Noort</i>
and the <i>South</i> rivers, being evidently in doubt which is the Hudson. Heylin had studied
geography better than his contemporary Robert Fage, who published about the same time
<i>A Description of the whole World</i>, London, 1658, but he is utterly silent as to New Netherland.
In 1667, when he published his <i>Cosmography, or a Description of the whole World,
represented by a more exact and certain Discovery</i>, he had learned that “to the Southwest
of New England lyeth the Dutch plantation; it hath good ground and good air, but few of
that Nation are inhabiting there, which makes that there are few plantations in the land,
they chiefly intending their East India trade, and but one village, whose inhabitants are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
part English, part Dutch. Here hath been no news on any matter of war or state since
the first settlement. There is the Port Orange, thirty miles up Hudson’s River,” etc. This
was written three years after New Netherland had become an English colony, when New
York city numbered almost two thousand inhabitants, and some ten or twelve villages were
flourishing on Long Island.</p>

<p>The best description, or rather the most ample, written by an Englishman, is that of
John Josselyn, who published his observations made during two voyages to New England
in 1638-1639 and 1663-1671.<a name="FNanchor_869_869" id="FNanchor_869_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a> Although he had been in the country, his notions concerning
it are somewhat crude. New England, under which name he includes New Netherland, is
thought to be an island formed by the “spacious” river of Canada, the Hudson, two great
lakes “not far off one another,” where the two rivers have their rise, and the ocean. His
account of the Indians, of their mode of living and warfare, is highly amusing, and at the
same time instructive, although no philologist would probably accept as correct his statement
that the Mohawk language was a dialect of the Tartar. Nor would the botanist place
implicit faith in the statement that in New England barley degenerated frequently into
oats; and the zoölogist would be astonished to learn of “frogs sitting upon their breeches
one foot high.” His credulity has led this eccentric <i>raconteur</i> into describing many similar
wonderful details; but his work is nevertheless of value, as giving, I believe, the first
complete description of the fauna and flora of the Middle Atlantic and New England States.
In some of his historical data he follows Plantagenet, probably at second-hand through
Heylin, and is so far without credit.</p>

<p>Religion, which had already done so much to increase the population of the colony on
the Hudson, was to cause a new invasion by the Dutch into their old possessions. While
Arminians and Gomarists, Cocceians and Vœtians, were continuing the religious strife in
Holland, a new sect, the Labadists, sprang up. The intolerance with which they were
treated compelled their leaders to look out for a country where they might exercise their
religion with perfect freedom. An attempt at colonization in Surinam, ceded to Holland
by England in the Treaty of Breda, 1667, having failed, they turned their eyes upon New
York, then under English rule, and in 1679 sent two of their most prominent men&mdash;Jasper
Danckers and Peter Sluyter&mdash;across the ocean to explore and report. The account of
their travels was procured, translated, and published by Mr. Henry C. Murphy in the
<i>Collections</i> of the Long Island Historical Society.<a name="FNanchor_870_870" id="FNanchor_870_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a> It tells in simple language, showing
frequently their religious bias, what the travellers saw and heard. The drawings with
which they illustrated their journal give us a vivid picture of New York two hundred
years ago. As they talked with many of the men who had been prominent in Dutch
times, their account of historical events acquires special interest. The tradition then
current at Albany, that the ruins of a fort on Castle Island indicated the place where
Spaniards had made a settlement before the Dutch, is discredited by them; but the discovery
of the so-called Pompey Stone, an evident Spanish relic, at not too great a distance
from the Hudson River, makes it desirable that this tradition should receive special investigation.
It is true the Indians in Van der Donck’s time who were old enough to
recollect when the Dutch first came, declared that they were the first white men whom
they saw;<a name="FNanchor_871_871" id="FNanchor_871_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a> but their descendants told these travellers “that the first strangers seen in
these parts were Spaniards or Portuguese; but they did not remain long, and afterwards
the Dutch came.” The Spaniards under Licenciado d’ Aillon had made landings and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
explored the country south and east of New York, and may not one of their exploring
parties have come to Albany and fortified themselves?</p>

<p>While Aitzema gives us, in his <i>Saken van Staat</i>, the Dutch side of the public affairs
in the seventeenth century, Thurloe,<a name="FNanchor_872_872" id="FNanchor_872_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a> in his <i>Collection of State Papers</i>, uncovers English
statesmanship and diplomacy. His official position as secretary to the Council of
State under Charles I., and afterwards to the Protector and his son, gave him a thorough
insight into the workings of the public machinery, and makes his selection of papers
extremely valuable. Among them will be found a document of the year 1656 on the
English rights to New Netherland, which is highly interesting. I can refer only by title
to other works of the seventeenth century speaking of New Netherland, as they are only
either more or less embellished and incorrect repetitions of former accounts, or because
they are beyond my reach.<a name="FNanchor_873_873" id="FNanchor_873_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a></p>

<p>Skipping over a century, we come to the work of a native of New York, the <i>History
of the Province of New York from its first Discovery to the Year 1732</i>, by William
Smith, Jr. Considering that it was written and published before the author had reached
his thirtieth year,<a name="FNanchor_874_874" id="FNanchor_874_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a> and that he had to gather his information from the then rare and scanty
libraries of America and the official records of the province, the work reflects no small
credit on its author. For the discovery by Hudson, he follows the accepted version,&mdash;that
Hudson in 1608, under a commission from King James I., first landed on Long Island,
etc., and afterward sold the country, or rather his rights, to the Dutch. Smith’s knowledge
of law should have prevented his repeating this statement, for he ought to have been
aware that Hudson could not have had any <i>individual</i> claim to the country discovered by
him. Another statement, repeated by Smith on the authority of elder writers,&mdash;namely,
that James I. had conceded to the Dutch in 1620 the right to use Staten Island as a
watering-place for their ships going to and coming from Brazil,&mdash;a careful perusal of the
correspondence between the authorities of New Netherland and the Directors of the
West India Company, then within easy reach, would have told him to be untrue or incorrect.
If there were any truth in this statement, for which I have not found the
slightest foundation, it would only prove that, with their usual tenacity of purpose, the
Dutch, having once determined to settle on Manhattan’s Island, could not be deterred from
carrying out their project. Although admitting that, in the long run, it would have been
impossible for the Dutch to preserve their colony against the increasing strength of their
English neighbors, he condemns the treachery with which New Netherland was wrested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
from the Dutch. It is to be regretted that with so many official Dutch documents as Smith
found in the office of the secretary, he did not write the history of the Dutch period of
the province with more detail, and that he studied those which he consulted with hardly
sufficient care.</p>

<p>Before a proper interest in the history of New York had been reawakened after the
exciting times of the Revolution and of 1812, it revived in the European cradle of New
York to such an extent as to bring forth a valuable contribution to our historical sources
from the pen of the learned Chevalier Lambrechtsen.<a name="FNanchor_875_875" id="FNanchor_875_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a> Its value consists principally in
the fact that the author had access to the papers of the West India Company, since lost,
and that it instigated research and called attention to the history of their State among New
Yorkers, several of whom now set to work writing histories.<a name="FNanchor_876_876" id="FNanchor_876_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a> Not one of them is of
great value now, the documents procured in the archives of Europe having thrown more
and frequently a different light on many facts. Many statements are given as based on
tradition, others are absolutely incorrect,<a name="FNanchor_877_877" id="FNanchor_877_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a> and none tell us anything about New Netherland
that we have not already read in De Laet, Van der Donck, and other older writers.</p>

<p>To the anti-rent troubles in this State and to the researches into the rights of
the patroons arising from them, we are indebted to the best work on New Netherland
which has yet been written. Chancellor Kent’s assertion, that the Dutch annals were of a
tame and pacific character and generally dry and uninteresting,<a name="FNanchor_878_878" id="FNanchor_878_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a> had deterred many from
their study. Now it became an absolute necessity to discover what privileges had been
held by the patroons under the Dutch government, and, upon examining the records, Dr.
E. B. O’Callaghan was amazed to find a vast amount of historical material secluded from
the English student by an unknown language. The writing of a history of that period,
which had been a dark page for so long a time, immediately suggested itself; and as about
the same time the papers relating to New York, which the State had procured abroad, were
sent home by Mr. Brodhead, the agent of the State, the plan was carried into effect, and
the <i>History of New Netherland, or New York under the Dutch</i>, by E. B. O’Callaghan,
New York, 1846, vol. ii. 1850, made its appearance.<a name="FNanchor_879_879" id="FNanchor_879_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span></p>

<p>It is perhaps beyond the possibilities of the human mind to write history, not simply
annals, from a thoroughly objective point of view; but the historian must try to suppress
his individuality as far as he can, or at least to criticise only the events of a remote period
from the standpoint of that period, and not from his own, which is more modern and
advanced. Dr. O’Callaghan followed no philosophy of history. He tried to suppress his
individuality as Irishman, Canadian revolutionist, and devout Romanist; but occasionally
it was stronger than his will, and impaired the objectivity and fairness of his judgment.
Yet the descendants of the settlers of New Netherland owe to him a greater debt than to
any of their own race, for he, first of any historian, has shown us the colony in its origin&mdash;the
steadiness, sturdiness, and industry of the colonists, who were men as religious as
the New England Puritans, but more tolerant towards adherents of other creeds. Notwithstanding
this historian’s desire to be accurate in his statements, his unqualified reliance
upon previous writers has on several occasions led him into errors, the gravest of which
is perhaps the repetition of Plantagenet’s story of Argal’s invasion. I have tried to show
above that the English documents disprove this statement, which O’Callaghan repeats on
the authority of Heylin.</p>

<p>J. Romeyn Brodhead, the collaborator of Dr. O’Callaghan in editing the documents
procured for the State by his agency, was the next to enter the field as a writer on the history
of New York. While Dr. O’Callaghan in a few instances allows his inborn prejudices
to make him criticise the actions of the Dutch too harshly, and without due allowance for
the times and circumstances, Mr. Brodhead, a descendant both of Dutch and English early
settlers, fails on the other side, and becomes too lenient. Generally, however, his <i>History
of New York</i> is written with great independence of judgment and with thorough criticism
of the authorities. It is to be regretted that death prevented the completion of the work,
which does not go farther than 1691; but what Mr. Brodhead has given us must, for its
completeness and accuracy of research, and for the genuine historical acumen displayed
in it, rank as a standard work and a classical authority on the subject.<a name="FNanchor_880_880" id="FNanchor_880_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a></p>

<p>There are many additional works to be consulted by those who desire reliable information
on the early history of New York,&mdash;the more general histories (like Bancroft’s,
chap. xv.), monographs,<a name="FNanchor_881_881" id="FNanchor_881_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a> and local histories, the <i>Transactions</i> of the various historical
societies of the State, etc.; but the passing of them in review has been in some degree
relegated to notes.</p>

<p class="p2">When the Greek philosopher Anaxagoras said that man was born to contemplate the
heavens, the sun, and the moon, he might have added also the earth and its formation in
all its details, and enjoined on his disciples the necessity of representing the result of such
contemplations by maps and charts. We require a map fully to understand the geography
and chorography of a country; hence a study of the maps made by contemporaneous
makers becomes the duty of the writer of New Netherland history. I have already stated
that the coast of New York and the neighboring districts were known to Europeans almost
a century before Hudson ascended the “Great River of the North,” and that this knowledge
is proved by various maps made in the course of the sixteenth century. Nearly all
of them place the mouth of a river between the fortieth and forty-first degrees of latitude,
or what should be this latitude, but which imperfect instruments have placed farther north.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
The configuration of the coast-line shows that they meant the mouth of the Hudson. Only
one, however, of these sixteenth-century maps, made by Vaz Dourado at Lisbon, in 1571,
gives the Hudson River in its almost entire course, from the mountains to the bay. A copy
of this map, made in 1580, which found its way to Munich, was probably seen by Peter
Plancius, who induced Hudson to explore that region of the New World, so little known
to Europeans at that time. Although Vaz Dourado’s map enlightens us so very little, I
mention it because his map must lead to the investigation of the question whether the
Dutch under Hudson were the first to navigate the river.</p>

The original parchment map measured 2 × 2 feet,
and showed the country from Egg Harbor, in
New Jersey, to the Penobscot, 40° to 45°. The
paper map covered the territory from below
the Delaware Capes to above Albany, and is

are preserved in the chromolithograph of it

<p>The oldest map of the territory now comprising the States of New York, New Jersey,
and Delaware, and known as “The Figurative Map,” was found by Mr. Brodhead in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
archives at the Hague. It is on parchment, and is beautifully executed. A fac-simile copy,
taken by Mr. Brodhead, was deposited in the State Library at Albany, and reproductions
have been published in the <i>New York Colonial Documents</i>, vol. i., also in Dr. O’Callaghan’s
<i>History of New Netherland</i>. It purports to have been submitted to the States-General
of Holland in 1616, with an application for a charter to trade to New Netherland,
but it was probably produced then a second time, having done duty before on a similar
occasion in 1614, with a map exhibiting the Delaware region on a larger scale. This 1614
map was on paper, and was found by Mr. Brodhead in the same place, and may be seen
in similar reproductions, accompanying those of the 1616 map. Who the draughtsman of
either was, is unknown. An inscription on the latter refers to draughts formerly made,
which were consulted, and to the report of some men, who had probably been the Dutchmen
captured by the Mohawks and mentioned in Captain Hendricksen’s report (<i>New
York Colonial Documents</i>, i. 13). De Laet seems to have had these maps before him when
he wrote his <i>Novus Orbis</i>, and to have constructed the map accompanying his work from
these two. Notwithstanding the great care and detail exhibited in them, they are necessarily
inaccurate, but highly interesting and instructive, as they indicate the location of
the several Indian tribes at the time of the arrival of the Dutch and of the Spaniards
before them. The names given on these maps to some of the Indian tribes are so unmistakably
of Spanish origin, that it is hard to believe they were not first applied by the
Spaniards, and afterwards repeated by the Indians to the before-mentioned three Dutch
prisoners among the Mohawks. We find one tribe called “Capitanasses,” while in colloquial
Spanish <i>capitanázo</i> means a great warrior; another, whom the Dutch later knew as Black
Minquas, is designated by the name of “Gachos,” the Spanish word <i>gacho</i> being applied to
black cattle. Still another is called the “Canoomakers;” <i>canoa</i> being a word of the Indian
tongues of South America,<a name="FNanchor_882_882" id="FNanchor_882_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a> the North American Indian could only have learned it from the
Spaniards, and in turn have taught its meaning to the Dutch. Even the Indian name given
to the island upon which the city of New York now stands, spelled on the earliest maps
“Monados, Manados, Manatoes,” and said to mean “a place of drunkenness,” points to
a Spanish origin from the colloquially-used noun <i>moñas</i>, drunkenness, <i>moñados</i>, drunken
men. If to these indications of Spanish presence on the soil of New York before the
Dutch period we add the evidence of the so-called Pompey Stone,<a name="FNanchor_883_883" id="FNanchor_883_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a> found in Oneida
County, with its Spanish inscription and date of 1520, and the names of places given in
their corruption by the Dutch in a grant covering part of Albany County (“Semesseerse,”
Spanish <i>semencera</i>, land sown with seed; “Negogance,” place for trade, Spanish <i>negocio</i>,
trade), we can no longer hesitate to believe that the traditions reported by Danckers and
other writers mentioned before had some foundation, and that the Spaniards knew and
had explored the country on the Hudson long before the Dutch came, but had thought,
as Peter Martyr expresses it, after the failures of Esteban Gomez and the Licenciado
d’ Aillon, “To the South, to the South, for the great and exceeding riches of the Equinoctial;
they that seek gold must not go to the cold and frozen North.” The Spaniards
never considered North America as of any value in itself; they looked upon it only as a
barrier to the richer fields of Asia.</p>

<p>Dr. O’Callaghan had in his collection<a name="FNanchor_884_884" id="FNanchor_884_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a> a copy, on vellum, of a map entitled “Americæ
Septentrionalis Pars,” from the <i>West-Indische Paskaert</i>, which he added to the maps in
the first volume of the <i>New York Colonial Documents</i>. The maker of it was A. Jacobsen,
and, to judge from the fac-simile of the West India Company’s seal exhibited on it, he
made it for that company in 1621. It bears internal evidence that Jacobsen had as model
one of the elder Spanish and English maps, as he retains some Spanish and English
names for places, which on the Dutch maps just mentioned have Dutch names. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
attempt is made to give details of interior chorography. The coast-line is fairly correct,
and the rivers named are indicated by their mouths.<a name="FNanchor_885_885" id="FNanchor_885_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a></p>

<p>The next in the order of date is also a manuscript map, of which a reduced copy was
published by Dr. O’Callaghan in his <i>History</i>. Although it is only a delineation of part
of New Netherland, the manor of Rensselaerswyck,<a name="FNanchor_886_886" id="FNanchor_886_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a> it is of importance to the historian,
who in consulting it has to exercise his judgment to the utmost. Made in 1630 by Gillis
van Schendel at the expense of six dollars, which paid also for four copies on paper, it
shows, in the very year in which the land was purchased from the Indians and patented
to the patroons, such a large number of settlements on both sides of the river, as to create
the suspicion that it was made to induce emigration from Holland, where the four copies
on paper were sent. De Laet, whose share of the land, as one of the patroons, is designated
by De Laet’s Burg, De Laet’s Island, De Laet’s Mill Creek and Waterfall, makes no
reference to this map.</p>

<p>The first printed map of New Netherland accompanies De Laet’s <i>Novus Orbis</i>, under
the title of “Nova Anglia, Novum Belgium, et Virginia.” In outline it resembles the map
of 1621 by Jacobsen, while the details are taken from the maps presented to the States-General.
It is very vague, however, and does not even give the names of any river.
Long Island is represented by three islands, and the Delaware River rises, as on the 1616
map, out of a large lake in the Seneca country.<a name="FNanchor_887_887" id="FNanchor_887_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a></p>

<p>Jacobsen’s map of 1621 seems to have been used by Robert Dudley in his <i>Atlas</i>, upon
which an Italian engraver, Antonio Francesco Lucini, worked; and Lucini’s signature
is attached to a “Carta particolare della Nuova Belgia è parte della Nuova Anglia,
d’America carta ii.,” which constitutes a part of Dudley’s work.<a name="FNanchor_888_888" id="FNanchor_888_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a> He seems to have
consulted Spanish, Dutch, and English maps of more or less correctness, but understood
none of them well. The Hudson is called “Rio Martins ò R. Hudsons.” Manhattan’s
Island is in its proper place, with New Amsterdam marked on it; but the name “Isla
Manhatas” is given to the land between Newark Bay, Passaic River on the west and
the Hackensack on the east; while the strip of land now called Bergen Point is called
“Oster’s Ilant.” The position of Manhattan has evidently troubled him very much, for
we find the name again inserted covering the eastern townships of Westchester County.
Stratford Point, at the mouth of the Housatonic, is “Cabo del Fieme,” while Long Island,
called “I. di Gebrok Land,” is a group of six islands, the largest of which bears the correct
name of Matouwacs, and Fisher’s Island is called “Isla Lange.” Staten Island,
“I. State,” is relegated, shorn of its dimensions, to Newark Bay, and its space divided by
“I. Godins” and one of the six islands in the Long Island group called “C. Godins.”
The low coast of New Jersey, near Long Branch, is properly named “Costa Bassa.”
Thence going south, we come to “Porto Eyer” (Egg Harbor) and “I. Eyer,” “C. Pedras
Arenas” (Barnegat), “C. Mai,” “Rio Carlo” (Delaware), and “C. Hinlopen ò C. James.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>”
The student of our early cartography must revert often to the rival maps and atlases
of Blaeu and Jansson. The elder of the Blaeus, W. J. Blaeu, was long a maker of maps
and globes,<a name="FNanchor_889_889" id="FNanchor_889_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a> and began to be known, with his map of the world, in 1606. He had issued
many other maps when, in 1631, he collected them into his <i>Appendix Theatri Ortelii</i> (103
maps), the earliest of his atlases, which he later remodelled and enlarged, sometimes
giving the text in French, and sometimes in Latin; that of 1638 being known as his
<i>Novas Atlas</i>, and containing fourteen American maps. After several intermediate issues,<a name="FNanchor_890_890" id="FNanchor_890_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a>
following upon the death of the elder Blaeu in 1638,<a name="FNanchor_891_891" id="FNanchor_891_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a> his atlas, under the care of his son,
John Blaeu,<a name="FNanchor_892_892" id="FNanchor_892_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a> was issued with various texts, and with a wealth of skill rarely equalled
since, as the <i>Atlas Major</i>.<a name="FNanchor_893_893" id="FNanchor_893_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a></p>

<p>Jansson produced a rival of the earliest Blaeu atlas in 1633, with one hundred and six
maps.<a name="FNanchor_894_894" id="FNanchor_894_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a> In 1638 it was called <i>Atlas Novus</i>, and had seventeen maps of America.<a name="FNanchor_895_895" id="FNanchor_895_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a> In
1639 a French edition was called <i>Nouveau Théâtre du Monde</i>, with new maps by Henry
Hondius, son of the elder Hondius, eighteen of them being American, and that on New
Netherland following De Laet’s map. It includes New England and Virginia, and is the
original of various later maps.<a name="FNanchor_896_896" id="FNanchor_896_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a> A fifth part of the <i>Nouveau Theatre</i> was added in 1657,
containing coast charts of America. Jansson reached his best in his <i>Orbis Antiquus</i>, of
about even date (1661) with Blaeu’s best.</p>

<p>In Mr. Edward Armstrong’s essay on <i>Fort Nassau</i> a map in private hands is
mentioned which seems to be little known. It exhibits the grant made to Sir Edmund
Ploeyden of the Province of New Albion, and was printed at London in 1651. It is
a strange combination of knowledge and ignorance, if not intentional deceit, purporting
to have been made by “Domina Virginia Farrer,” and shows the headwaters of James
River to be within ten days’ march of the California coast.<a name="FNanchor_897_897" id="FNanchor_897_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a></p>

<p>A map of the Delaware territory was made, about 1638, by Måns Kling, for the
Swedish Government. A later map of the same region, made by the Swedish engineer
Peter Lindstroem in 1654, unfortunately destroyed by fire in 1697, when the Royal Palace
at Stockholm burned down, is reviewed in another chapter. A Dutch map of the Delaware,
made about 1656, has also been lost.<a name="FNanchor_898_898" id="FNanchor_898_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Asher<a name="FNanchor_899_899" id="FNanchor_899_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a> and Mr. Armstrong incline to the opinion that the earliest of the later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
group of maps made during the Dutch occupancy is the original state of what is called
Dancker’s map, known under the title of <i>Novi Belgii Novæque Angliæ necnon Pennsylvaniæ
et Partis Virginiæ tabula, multis in locis emendata a Justo Danckers</i>, and supposed
to date between 1650 and 1656.<a name="FNanchor_900_900" id="FNanchor_900_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a> The map purporting to be the oldest, and which there is
reason to believe was this earlier plate retouched, is the <i>Novi Belgii, etc., tabula multis in
locis emendata a Nicolao Joannis Visschero</i>, of which Asher speaks of a copy in the Royal
Library at the Hague.<a name="FNanchor_901_901" id="FNanchor_901_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a></p>

<h3><a name="c439" id="c439">EDITORIAL NOTES.</a></h3>

<p class="p2"><b>A.</b> <span class="smcap">Bibliography.</span>&mdash;In the bibliography
of New Netherland, the first place must be given
to the <i>Bibliographical and Historical Essay on
the Dutch Books and Pamphlets relating to New
Netherland</i>, by G. M. Asher, Amsterdam, 1854-1867,
the work appearing in parts. It embodies
the results of work in the royal library and
in the royal archives at the Hague; at Leyden
in the library of the University and in that of Dr.
Bodel Nyenhuis, rich in maps, and particularly
in the Thysiana Library, which he found a rich
field; and at Amsterdam, among the extensive
stock of Mr. Frederick Muller, without whose
assistance, the author says, the book would not
have been written.<a name="FNanchor_904_904" id="FNanchor_904_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a> In his Introduction he gives
a succinct sketch of the history and geography
of New Netherland.</p>

<p>Next in importance are the catalogues of
Frederick Muller of Amsterdam, particularly
the series, <i>Catalogue of Books, Maps, and Plates
on America</i>,<a name="FNanchor_905_905" id="FNanchor_905_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a> begun in 1872, and which he calls
“an essay towards a Dutch-American bibliography.”
It was also under Mr. Muller’s direction
and patronage that Mr. P. A. Tiele prepared
his <i>Mémoire bibliographique sur les journaux des
navigateurs néerlandais réimprimés dans les collections
de De Bry et de Hulsius</i>, etc., Amsterdam,
1867. It covers those voyages not Dutch of which
accounts have appeared in Dutch, as well as the
distinctively Dutch collections. The compiler
dedicated it to Mr. James Lenox, from whose
rich collection he derived much help. Muller’s
<i>Catalogue</i> (1872), no. 110; Stevens, <i>Hist. Coll.</i>,
i. 1,002.</p>

<p>The best American collection of books on
New Netherland is probably that now in the
Lenox Library. Mr. Asher said of it some
years ago (<i>Essay</i>, p. xlix, <i>sub anno</i> 1867) that it
was “absolutely complete.”</p>

<p class="p1"><b>B.</b> <span class="smcap">New Amsterdam.</span>&mdash;The earliest accounts
of the town by Wassenaer (1623), De
Laet (1625), De Rasiere (1627), and Michaelis
(1628), have already been mentioned. (Cf. the
paper on the first settlement by the Dutch in
<i>Doc. Hist. N. Y.</i>, vol. iii.) Stuyvesant, in his
letter to Nicoll in 1664, claimed that the town
was founded in 1623. This statement is repeated
in De la Croix’s book, with De Vries’s additions,
published in Dutch as <i>Algemeene Wereldt-Beschrijving</i>,
1705. (Asher, no. 19.) O’Callaghan,
<i>New Netherland</i>, ii. 210, has established that the
town was incorporated in 1653.</p>

<p>The original Dutch records of New Amsterdam
have been put into English in MS. volumes
in the archives of the city, and some parts of
them are printed in Valentine’s <i>New York City
Manual</i>, and in <i>Historical Magazine</i>, xi. 33, 108,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
170, 224, 354; xii. 30; xiii. 39, 168. Cf. paper
on the development of its municipal government
in the Dutch period, in <i>Mag. of Amer.
Hist.</i>, May, 1882, and the papers on the city
of New York in <i>Doc. Hist. N. Y.</i>, vols. i. and
iii. Some notes on the Indian incursions in
and about New Amsterdam during the Dutch
period are in Valentine’s <i>New York City Manual</i>,
1863, p. 533. The principal histories of
the town are Martha J. Lamb’s (1877), M. L.
Booth’s (1859), W. L. Stone’s (1872), and
David T. Valentine’s (1853). The last comes
down only to 1750, and this and Lamb’s are
of the most importance.</p>

        <p class="pf400">This fac-simile of the lower portion of the map entitled “De Noord Rivier, anders R. Manhattans, off
Hudson’s Rivier, genaamt t’Groodt,” which appeared in a tract at Middleburgh (and also at the Hague in
1666 in Goos’s <i>Zee-Atlas</i>) in answer to the reply of Downing to the memoir (1664) of the deputies of the
States-General. The cut is made from the reproduction in Mr. Lenox’s edition of H. C. Murphy’s translation
of the <i>Vertoogh</i> and <i>Breeden Raedt</i>, New York, 1854. The North is to the right.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Something can be
derived from the gatherings of J. F. Watson in
his <i>Annals of New York City and State</i>, 1846,
and the appendix to his <i>Annals of Philadelphia</i>,
1830. The reader will find interest in
various local antiquarian quests, as exemplified
in J. W. Gerard’s <i>Old Streets of New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
York under the Dutch</i> (1874).<a name="FNanchor_906_906" id="FNanchor_906_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a> A map of the
original grants of village lots on the island, from
the Dutch West India Company, is in the <i>City
Manual</i> (1857), and in the same (1856) is a map
showing the made and swampy lands, as indicating
the original surface of the town. In other
volumes (1852 and 1853), and in Valentine’s <i>History</i>,
p. 379, is a modern plan of the city, showing
the line of the original high-water marks and the
location of the early farms. It is one of these
farms, that of Dominie Bogardus, the pastor of
the Dutch church, who so vigorously opposed
Kieft’s plans, that is now the property of
Trinity Church, and the source of a large revenue.
(See the Key in Valentine’s <i>History</i>, p.
380.) The same serial preserves views of sundry
landmarks, like the canal in Broad Street,
of 1659 (in 1862, p. 515), a windmill of 1661 (in
1862, p. 547), a house built in 1626 (in 1847,
p. 346). A plan of the fort built in 1633-1635
is in Valentine’s <i>New York</i>, p. 27; and at p. 38
is a plan of the town in 1642, as well as the
author could make it out from existing data.</p>

<p>For the northern part of the island, James
Riker’s <i>History of Harlem</i>, 1881, affords much
interest, tracing more minutely than usual the associations
of the early comers with their family
stocks in Europe, and showing by a map the original
locations of their house-lots at Harlem.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>C.</b> <span class="smcap">Local Histories.</span>&mdash;The Editor is not
aware of any considerable bibliography of New
York local histories, except
as they are included
in F. B. Perkins’s <i>Check
List of American Local
History</i>. Some help may
be derived from the <i>Brinley</i>
and <i>Alofsen Catalogues</i>,
and others of a classified
character. We have indicated
in another Note the labors of Mr. Munsell
for the Albany region. An edition of G. Furman’s
<i>Antiquities of Long Island</i>, edited by F. Moore in
1875, includes a bibliography of Long Island by
Henry Onderdonk, Jr. The most considerable
of all the local histories is Stiles’s <i>History of
Brooklyn</i>, 1867-1870, which gives a map of the
Breuckelen settlements in 1646. The Faust Club
in 1865 issued (125 copies) an older book, G. Furman’s
<i>Notes of Brooklyn</i>, which had originally
appeared in 1824. Benj. F. Thompson’s <i>History
of Long Island</i>, 2d ed., 1843, is the most comprehensive
of the accounts of that island, while
N. S. Prime’s <i>History of Long Island</i> is more
particularly concerned with its ecclesiastical history.
There are various lesser monographs on
the island towns, like Riker’s <i>Newton</i> (1852),
Onderdonk’s <i>Hempstead</i> (1878), etc. Cf. also
<i>Historical Magazine</i>, viii. 89; and in the same,
vi. 145, Mr. G. P. Disosway recounts the early
history of Staten Island.</p>

<p>Mr. Fernow translated and edited in the <i>Documents
relative to the Colonial History of New
York</i>, vol. xiii., the papers in the State archives
upon the history and settlements on the Hudson
and the Mohawk (1630-1684), as he has said in
the text, which must stand as
the basis for much which is
given in the special treatises
of Bolton on <i>West Chester
County</i> (or such thorough
monographs as that of C.
W. Baird on the <i>History of
Rye</i>, 1781 in this county), P.
H. Smith on <i>Duchess County</i>, 1877, not to name
others. The more remote parts of the State
have little or no connection with the Dutch
period.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>D.</b> <span class="smcap">The Dutch Governors.</span>&mdash;Mr. George
Folsom has a paper on the governors in 2 <i>N. Y.
Hist. Coll.</i>, vol. i. On Peter Minuit, the first
governor, there is a paper by J. B. Moore in
<i>N. Y. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, 1849, p. 73, and another
in <i>Historical Magazine</i>, xiii. 205. An autograph
of Kieft is given herewith. Of Stuyvesant, the
last governor, who survived the surrender, and
died in 1672 (Brodhead, ii. 183), we have various
memorials. His portrait is preserved, belonging
to Mr. Robert Van Rensselaer Stuyvesant,
and has been engraved several times,&mdash;Dunlap’s
<i>New York</i>, vol. i.; O’Callaghan’s <i>New Netherland</i>,
vol. ii.; Lamb’s New York, i. 127; Gay’s
<i>Popular History of the United States</i>, vol. ii. (Cf.
<i>Catalogue of the N. Y. Hist. Soc. Gallery</i>, no. 67.)
Two reminders of him long remained to New
Yorkers,&mdash;his house in the Bowery, which is
shown as it existed at the time of his death in
Valentine’s <i>New York</i>, p. 53, and in his <i>Manual</i>,
1852, p. 407; and in Watson’s <i>Annals of New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
York</i>, p. 196, as it stood later perched upon so
much of the original knoll as improvements had
not removed. The old pear-tree associated with
his name is depicted in Valentine’s <i>Manual</i>, 1861,
p. 533, and in Lossing’s <i>Hudson River</i>, p. 416.</p>

<p>Mr. Fernow contributed to the <i>Magazine
of American History</i>, ii. 540, a monograph on
Stuyvesant’s journey to Esopus in 1658. See
also 4 <i>Massachusetts Historical Collections</i>, vi.
533.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>E.</b> <span class="smcap">Levinus Hulsius’s Collection of
Voyages.</span>&mdash;The twenty-six parts of this work
were originally issued between 1598 and 1650,
and this long interval, as well as their German
text finding more popular use than the Latin of
De Bry, has conduced to make sets much rarer
of Hulsius than of De Bry. Scholars also award
Hulsius the possession of more judgment in
compiling and translating than is claimed for
De Bry. Asher printed in 1833 a <i>Short Bibliographical
Memoir</i> of Hulsius, which became,
when extended, his <i>Bibliographical Essay on the
Voyages and Travels of Hulsius and his Successors</i>,
in 1839; and in this he doubts if a perfect
set of all the editions of all the parts had ever
been got together. An approximate completeness,
however, pertains to the sets in the Carter-Brown
and Lenox libraries, as described in the
<i>Catalogue</i> of the former, vol. i. p. 467, and in the
<i>Contributions to a Catalogue of the Lenox Library</i>,
no. i, New York, 1877. The set described in
this shows all the first editions of the twenty-six
parts, with second issues of three of them, Latin
as well as German of two of them; two parts
successively issued of one of them (part xi.) and
other copies with variations of three of them.
There are eighteen second editions, counting variations
(one is lacking); nine third editions or
variations; six fourth editions (with one lacking);
two fifth editions (with one lacking). This
would indicate that an absolutely complete set,
to include every part, edition, and variety, would
increase the twenty-six parts to seventy-three.
The Carter-Brown copy seems to be less perfect.
The <i>Huth Catalogue</i> shows a complete series
of first editions only.</p>

<p>Tiele’s <i>Mémoire Bibliographique</i> pertains to
such voyages in this collection as were made by
Dutch navigators. Sabin’s <i>Dictionary</i>, viii. 526,
gives fuller collations for the parts relating to
America. Quaritch printed a collation in 1860.</p>

<p>Bohn published a collation of Lord Lyndsay’s
copy.</p>

<p>The Lenox Library possesses MS. Collations
of the Grenville and other sets in the British
Museum, of those in the Royal Library, Berlin,
and the City Library of Hamburg.</p>

<p>Sets of such completeness as collectors may
hope to attain have been quoted at £335 (Crowninshield
sale, 1860,&mdash;all first editions but one),
and 6,700 and 4,500 marks.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE honor of projecting the first Swedish settlement in foreign parts
is due to Willem Usselinx,&mdash;a native of Antwerp, who resided for
several years in Spain, Portugal, and the Azores, and was afterward engaged
in mercantile pursuits in
Holland, acquiring distinction as
the chief founder of the Dutch
West India Company.<a name="FNanchor_907_907" id="FNanchor_907_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a></p>

<p>Failing to obtain adequate remuneration for his
services in the Netherlands, he visited Sweden, and succeeded in inducing
Gustavus II. (Adolphus) to issue a <i>Manifest</i> at Gottenburg, Nov. 10,
1624, instituting a general commercial society, called the Australian Company,
with special privileges of traffic with Africa, Asia, and America.
Authority was conferred on Usselinx to solicit subscriptions, and a contract
of trade was drawn up to be signed by the contributors, the whole
scheme being commended in a paper of great length by the projector
of it. On the 14th of June, 1626, a more ample charter was conceded,
which was confirmed in the Riksdag of 1627,<a name="FNanchor_908_908" id="FNanchor_908_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a> and followed by an order
of the sovereign requiring subscribers to make their payments by May,
1628. The King himself pledged 400,000 daler of the royal treasure
on equal risks, and other members of his family took stock in the Company,
which embraced the Royal Council, the most distinguished of
the nobility, officers of the army, bishops and other clergymen, burgomasters
and aldermen of the cities, and many of the commonalty.</p>

<p>It was believed that the enterprise would prove of great commercial benefit to
Sweden, besides affording private individuals opportunity to recover fortunes
lost through the disastrous wars of the period, and furnishing, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
colonies to be established, safe places of retreat for many exiles. By means
of a union, in 1630, with the Ship Company, instituted by agreement of the
cities of Sweden, at the Riksdag of the preceding year, the Australian&mdash;or,
as it was now generally called, the South&mdash;Company acquired the control
of sixteen well-equipped vessels, which they proceeded to send to sea. No
advantage, however, was derived from any of the voyages made, and in
1632 four of the ships were taken by Spain.</p>

conflicts of the age diverted the attention of the monarch and drained the
resources of the country, causing inevitable delay in carrying out the plans
of the Company, until at last it was determined to seek the aid of foreign
capital. Just before the battle of Lützen closed the earthly career of
Gustavus, a new charter was prepared for his signature, extending the
privileges of the former one to the inhabitants
of Germany, and prolonging
the enjoyment of them until the first day of January,
1646. This paper, which was already dated, was
published by Axel Oxenstjerna, Chancellor of the Kingdom
of Sweden,<a name="FNanchor_909_909" id="FNanchor_909_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a> at Heilbronn, April 10, 1633, and was confirmed,
with certain modifications, by the Deputies of the four
Upper Circles at Frankfort, Dec. 12, 1634.</p>

<p>Another, written at the same
time and signed by the Chancellor May 1, 1633, recognized Usselinx as
“Head Director of the New South Company,” with
authority to receive subscriptions and promote
the undertaking; in discharge of which duty the
zealous Belgian issued a fresh defence
of his project, addressed especially
to the Germans, besides
reprinting in their language the earlier documents on the subject. Nevertheless,
no success attended even this well-advertised revival of the long-cherished
enterprise, and subsequent appeals of Usselinx to France and
England, the Hanse Towns, and the States-General appear to have been
without result.<a name="FNanchor_910_910" id="FNanchor_910_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a></p>

<p>The first real advance towards the founding of New Sweden was made
in 1635. In May of that year Chancellor Oxenstjerna visited Holland, and
on his return home held correspondence upon the advantages of forming
a Swedish settlement on
the coast of Brazil
or Guinea,
with Samuel Blommaert, a merchant of Amsterdam
and a member of the Dutch West India Company, who
had participated five years before in an attempt to colonize
the shores of the Delaware; and in the following spring he commissioned
Peter Spiring, another Dutchman, dwelling in Sweden, to learn whether
some assistance might
not be obtained
from the States-General.
With this
intent, proposals were made by Usselinx, now Swedish minister, to induce
the States of Holland to found a “Zuid-Compagnie,” in conjunction with
his Government; but the Assembly of the Nineteen (to whom the matter
was referred) refusing their consent, the States postponed further action in
the premises.</p>

         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>Nevertheless, if failure attended this appeal to the rulers
of the nation, Spiring’s intercourse with private individuals had a happier
issue; and conversations with Blommaert introduced to his acquaintance
Peter Minuit, or Minnewit, a native of Wesel, who had served the Dutch
West India Company from 1626 to 1632 as Director-General of New Netherland,<a name="FNanchor_911_911" id="FNanchor_911_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a>
living in New Amsterdam, and who was then once more residing in
Cleves,&mdash;the person who was destined to conduct the first Swedish expedition
to America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span></p>

<p>In a letter dated at Amsterdam, June 15, 1636,<a name="FNanchor_912_912" id="FNanchor_912_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a> borne home by Spiring,
Minuit offered “to make a voyage to the Virginias, New Netherland, and
other regions adjoining, certain places well known to him, with a very good
climate, which might be named Nova Suedia;” and this proposal, or one
grounded on it, was read in the Swedish Råd, the 27th of September. Soon
afterward Spiring was again sent out to Holland as minister; and on further
consultation with Minuit and Blommaert, now Swedish Commissary (or consul-general)
at Amsterdam, it was determined to form a Swedish-Dutch
Company to carry on trade with, and establish colonies on, portions of the
North American coast not previously taken up by the Dutch or English.
The cost of the first expedition was estimated at twenty-four thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
(it actually amounted to over thirty-six thousand) Dutch florins, half of
which was to be contributed by Minuit and Blommaert and their friends,
and the remaining half to be subscribed in Sweden. Minuit was to be
the leader of it, and Blommaert the commissioner in Amsterdam. After
these stipulations had been concluded, in February, 1637, Minuit set out
for Stockholm. The Government embraced the scheme, and promised
to place two fully-equipped vessels at the disposal of the Company,
while the contribution of money required from Sweden was subscribed
by Axel Oxenstjerna, his brother Gabriel Gustafsson Oxenstjerna, their
cousin Gabriel Bengtsson Oxenstjerna,
and Clas Fleming (Royal Councillors
and Guardians of Queen Christina), and
Peter Spiring.</p>

</div>

<p>Fleming, like the Chancellor, was a
very zealous promoter of the project, and, as virtual
chief of the admiralty (the head-admiral was aged and
disqualified for service), obtained a commission to fit out the
ships, concerting the details with Minuit and Blommaert, who
procured an experienced crew and suitable cargo in Holland.
The vessels were sent over to Gottenburg during the spring, when the
expedition was to start. Delays occurred, however, and the vessels,&mdash;the
“Kalmar Nyckel” (Key of Calmar), a man-of-war, under Captain
Anders Nilsson Krober, and the sloop “Gripen” (the Griffin), Lieutenant
Jacob Borben commander, both belonging to the United South and Ship
Company,&mdash;did not receive their passports before the 9th of August, and
were not ready to sail until late in the autumn. Soon after leaving, they
encountered severe storms, and were obliged to put into the Dutch harbor
of Medemblik for repairs and fresh provisions, but set out once more in
December for their place of destination.</p>

<p>Here they arrived not later than March, 1638, Minuit exercising his
discretion as commander of the expedition to direct his course to the
River Delaware, with which, under the name of the South River of New
Netherland, he had become acquainted during his former sojourn in
America. According to Campanius, the colonists first landed on the west
side of Delaware Bay, below the Mordare Kil (Murderkill Creek), at a
place they called Paradis Udden (Paradise Point), “probably,” says he,
“because it seemed so grateful and agreeable.” They afterward proceeded
up the river, and on the 29th of March Minuit concluded a purchase
of land from five chiefs of the Minquas (belonging to the great
Iroquois race), appropriately rewarding them with articles of merchandise.
The territory thus acquired embraced the west shore of the Delaware, from
Bomtiens Udden (near Bombay Hook) northward to the River Schuylkill,
no limit being assigned towards the interior.<a name="FNanchor_913_913" id="FNanchor_913_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a> At its boundaries Minuit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
erected posts bearing the insignia of his sovereign, designating the country
as <span class="smcap">New Sweden</span>, and immediately built a fort, called, in honor of the
queen,<a name="FNanchor_914_914" id="FNanchor_914_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a> Christina,
at a point of rocks
about two miles
from the mouth
of the Minquas
(now Christeen)
Creek, to which stream he gave the name of Elbe.</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-448a.jpg" width="250" height="69" id="i448a"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>Soon after his arrival
he despatched “Gripen” to Jamestown, in Virginia, for a cargo of tobacco
to carry to Sweden free of duty,&mdash;a privilege which the governor
declined to grant, out of regard to the instructions of the English king,
while the Treasurer of the Province wrote to Sir Francis Windebanke,
Principal Secretary to Charles I., suggesting the removal of the Swedes
from the neighborhood of the Delaware, which he described as “the confines
of Virginia and New England,” claiming it as appertaining to his
sovereign. The sloop was suffered to remain “ten days, to refresh with
wood and water,” and then returned to Minuit. Subsequently the Swedish
commander sent her up the river for purposes of traffic, when he was
summarily challenged by the Dutch at Fort Nassau, a stronghold built in
1623, by Cornelis Jacobsen Mey, at Timber Creek on the east side of the
Delaware, which had afterward been abandoned and reoccupied several
times, and was then in the possession of traders from New Amsterdam.
The actions of Minuit were also reported by the Assistant-Commissary at
that place to Willem Kieft, the Director-General of New Netherland, and
were in turn communicated by Kieft, in a letter of the 28th of April, to the
Directors of the West India Company in Holland, and were made the
subject of a formal protest, addressed by Kieft to Minuit, the 6th of May,
claiming jurisdiction over the South River for the Dutch. No heed was
paid, however, to remonstrances of either Hollanders or English; and
Minuit proceeded to improve his fort by building two log-houses in the
inclosure for the accommodation of the garrison, while he stocked it plentifully
with provisions, leaving a portion of his cargo to be used in barter
with the Indians, “all whose peltries,” says Governor Kieft, “he had attracted
to himself by liberal gifts.”</p>

<div class="floatright">

</div>

<p>The colonists who remained in New
Sweden numbered twenty-three men, under the command of Lieutenant
Måns Kling (the only Swede expressly named as taking part in this first
expedition to the Delaware), who had charge of the military affairs, and
Hendrick Huygen, a relative of
Minuit, likewise born in Cleves,
who was intrusted with the civil
and economical duties of the
direction. Minuit himself departed for the West Indies, probably in July,
on board the “Kalmar Nyckel,” having sent “Gripen” thither before him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
After disposing of his merchandise, and securing a cargo of tobacco
at the Island of St. Christopher, while paying a visit to a Dutch ship
lying near by, he perished by the destruction of that vessel in a sudden
and violent storm. The “Kalmar Nyckel” had the good fortune to
escape, and soon afterward sailed for Sweden, but was forced by November
gales to take refuge in a port of Holland; while “Gripen” returned
to the Delaware, and, obtaining a load of furs, acquired by traffic with
the Indians, set out for Gottenburg, where she arrived at the close of
May, 1639.</p>

</div>

<p>A second expedition to New Sweden had already been projected,
which Queen Christina and the Swedish partners in the South Company
determined to render more national in character than
that conducted by Minuit. Natives
of Sweden were particularly invited
to engage in it; and none volunteering
to do so, the governors of
Elfsborg and Värmland were directed
to procure married soldiers
who had evaded service
or committed some other capital
offence, who, with their
wives and children, were promised the liberty of returning home at pleasure
at the end of one or two years.</p>

</div>

<p>Through the zeal of Fleming, the
President of the College of Commerce,
and his efficient secretary
Johan Beier, a number of emigrants
were at last assembled at
Gottenburg, and put on board the
“Kalmar Nyckel,” freshly equipped
and provided with a new crew by
Spiring and Blommaert in Holland, and commanded by a Dutch captain,
Cornelis van Vliet, who had been for several years in the Swedish service.
The vessel was also to carry out the second governor of New Sweden,
Lieutenant Peter Hollender, commissioned July 1, 1639, who was probably,
as his name indicates, a Dutchman, and (since he signed himself
“Ridder”) doubtless a nobleman. The ship sailed in the beginning of
autumn, but, springing a leak in the German Ocean, was obliged thrice to
return to Holland for repairs, when the captain was finally discharged
for dishonesty and negligence, and another, named Pouwel Jansen, was
engaged to take his place. At length, on the 7th of February, 1640, the
“Kalmar Nyckel” left the Texel, and reached Christina in safety the
17th of the following April.<a name="FNanchor_915_915" id="FNanchor_915_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span></p>

<p>How the first settlers had fared since the departure of Minuit, we are
unfortunately not informed by them; but it is testified by Governor Kieft
that they succeeded in appropriating a large trade with the natives, which
“wholly ruined” that of the Dutch. Still, according to the same authority,
the arrival of the second colony was singularly opportune, since they had
determined to quit the Delaware and remove the very next day to New
Amsterdam. Such an intention was of course at once abandoned, and
Governor Hollender strengthened his foothold on the river by securing a
title from the Indians to the western bank of it as far north as Sankikan
(near Trenton Falls), in spite of the protests of the Dutch Commissary,
who even fired upon him as he sailed past Fort Nassau. A letter of
remonstrance was sent to this officer by the Swedish governor, but his
instructions requiring him to deal gently with the Hollanders, and his
people being afterward treated by Governor Kieft “with all civility,” no
serious collisions occurred between the rival nations during his direction of
the colony. The “Kalmar Nyckel” was soon made ready for her return
voyage, and, sailing in May, arrived in July at Gottenburg.</p>

<p>The constant intercourse of the Swedish authorities with prominent merchants
of Amsterdam in founding the Colony of New Sweden had by this
time attracted the attention of other Hollanders to the settlement now successfully
established, and the liberality of the terms accorded the Swedish
company induced Myndert Myndertsen van Horst, of Utrecht, to appeal to
Queen Christina for the privilege of planting a Dutch colony within the
limits of her territory, after the model of the patroonships of their own
West India Company. This favor was conceded in a charter of the 24th
of January, 1640, which was transferred by Van Horst to Hendrik Hoochcamer
and other fellow-countrymen, granting the right to take up land on
both sides of the Delaware, four or five German miles below Christina, to be
held hereditarily under the Crown of Sweden, with freedom from taxation
for ten years, but subject to the restriction that their trade be carried on in
vessels built in New Sweden and confined to Swedish ports, and also assuring
liberty for the exercise of their so-called Reformed religion. Simultaneously
with the charter, a passport was issued for the ship “Fredenburg,”
Captain Jacob Powelsen, to carry the emigrants, and a commission for Jost
van Bogardt, as Swedish agent in New Sweden, with special authority over
this colony. The latter was likewise the leader of the expedition, which was
composed chiefly of persons from the province of Utrecht; and he arrived
with it at the Delaware on the 2d of November, 1640. The Dutchmen
appear to have seated themselves three or four Swedish miles from Christina.
So little mention, however, is afterward made of this peculiarly constituted
settlement,<a name="FNanchor_916_916" id="FNanchor_916_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a> it seems probable that it soon lost its individuality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span></p>

<p>About this time occurred the first attempt on the part of the inhabitants
of New England to obtain a foothold in New Sweden. Captain Nathaniel
Turner is said to have bought land from the Indians “on both sides of
Delaware Bay or River,” as agent of New Haven, in 1640; and in April,
1641, a similar purchase was made by George Lamberton, also of New
Haven, notwithstanding one of the tracts acquired in this manner was
comprised within that long before sold by the natives to the Swedish governors,
while the other, extending from Cape May to Narraticons Kil
(or Raccoon Creek), on the eastern shore of the Delaware, had been conveyed
only three days earlier, by the same sachem, to Governor Hollender.
Taking advantage of this nugatory title, and in contravention of
engagements entered into with Director Kieft, some twenty English families,
numbering about sixty persons, settled at Varkens Kil (now Salem
Creek, New Jersey), whose “plantations” were pronounced, at a General
Court held in New Haven, Aug. 30, 1641, to be “in combination with”
that town.</p>

<p>Meanwhile preparations were making in Sweden to send forth a fresh
expedition to America. On the 13th of July, 1640, the Governor of Gottenburg
was enjoined to persuade families of his province to emigrate, “with
their horses and cattle and other personal property.” On the 29th the
Governor of Värmland and Dal was directed to enlist certain Finns, who
had been forced to enter the army as a punishment for violating a royal
edict against clearing land in that province by burning forests; and on the
30th the Governor of Örebro was instructed to induce people of the same
race, roaming about the mining districts under his jurisdiction, to accompany
the rest to the Transatlantic Colony. Lieutenant Måns Kling, who
had returned in the “Kalmar Nyckel,” was also especially commissioned,
on the 26th of the following September, to aid in this work in the mining
regions and elsewhere, and particularly to procure homeless Finns, who
were living in the woods upon the charity of the settled population of
Sweden. In all these mandates the fertility of the new country and the
advantages of colonists in it are clearly intimated; and in the last it is
declared to be the royal aim that the inhabitants of the kingdom may
enjoy the valuable products of that land, increase in commerce and in
knowledge of the sea, and enlarge their intercourse with foreign nations.
In May, 1641, the people collected by Kling accompanied him on the ship
“Charitas” from Stockholm to Gottenburg, where they were joined by the
others, who by that time were ready to set forth. On the 20th of February
the Government had resolved to buy out the Dutch partners in their enterprise,
instructing Spiring to pay them eighteen thousand gulden from the
public funds, provided they abandoned all further claims. This, no doubt,
was done; and thus the third Swedish expedition to New Sweden sailed
under the auspices of a purely Swedish company. It comprised the well-tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
“Kalmar Nyckel” and the “Charitas,” and arrived at its place of
destination probably in the summer or autumn of 1641.<a name="FNanchor_917_917" id="FNanchor_917_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a></p>

<p>Nothing is known with regard to New Sweden at this period; but in
the spring of 1642 some of the colonists from New Haven, already spoken
of, took possession of a tract of land, which they claimed to have purchased
of the Indians on the 19th of April, on the west side of the Delaware, extending
from Crum Creek a short distance above the Schuylkill, and proceeded
to build a trading-house on the latter stream. This attracted the
attention of Director Kieft, and on the 22d of May he despatched two
sloops from New Amsterdam with instructions to Jan Jansen van Ilpendam,
the Dutch commissary at Fort Nassau, to expel the English from the Delaware.
His orders were promptly executed; and the settlements on the
Schuylkill and (it is said) at Varkens Kil were broken up, partly through
the aid of the Swedes, who had agreed with Kieft “to keep out the
English,” the trespassers being taken to Fort Amsterdam, from whence
they were sent home to New Haven. Lamberton, still persisting in trading
on the Delaware, was arrested not long afterward at Manhattan, and compelled
to give an account of his peltries, and to pay duties on his cargo.
According to Governor John Winthrop, of Massachusetts, such “sickness
and mortality” prevailed this summer in New Sweden as “dissolved” the
plantations of the English, and seriously affected the Swedes.</p>

<div class="floatleft">

         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>In Sweden the interest in the little American colony was now at its
height; and in July and August, 1642, Spiring was consulted in the Råd
and the Räkningekammår upon the question of appropriating the funds of
the South and Ship Company for the expenses of another expedition across
the ocean. This resulted in the formation of a new company, styled the
West India, American, or New Sweden Company, although oftener known
as the South Company, with a capital of thirty-six thousand riksdaler, half
being contributed by the South and Ship Company, one sixth by the
Crown, and the remainder by Oxenstjerna,
Spiring, Fleming, and others.
To it, also, was transferred the monopoly
of the tobacco trade in Sweden,
Finland, and Ingermanland, which
had been granted to the South Company in 1641.
On the 15th of August a third governor was commissioned
to succeed Hollender in the direction of New Sweden; namely,
Johan Printz, who had taken part in the Thirty Years’ War as Lieutenant-Colonel
of the West Götha Cavalry, and, after his dismissal from the service
for the capitulation of Chemnitz, was engaged in 1641 in procuring
emigrants for the colony in Northern Finland. He had been restored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
to royal favor and ennobled in July. His “Instructions” were likewise
dated Aug. 15, 1642, and were signed by Peter Brahe, Herman Wrangel,
Clas Fleming, Axel Oxenstjerna, and Gabriel Bengtsson Oxenstjerna,
Councillors of the Kingdom and Guardians of Queen Christina, who was
still in her minority. They are comprised in twenty-eight articles, endowing
him with extensive authority in the administration of justice, and
enjoining him to keep the monopoly of the fur-trade, and to pay particular
attention to the cultivation of the soil,&mdash;especially for the planting
of tobacco, of which he was expected to ship a goodly quantity on every
vessel returning to Sweden,&mdash;as well as to have a care of the raising of
cattle, of the obtaining of choice woods, of the growth of the grape, production
of silk, manufacture of salt, and taking of fish. He was to maintain
the Swedish Lutheran form of religion and education of the young,
and treat the Indians “with all humanity,” endeavoring to convert them
from their paganism, and “in other ways bring them to civilization and
good government.” His territory was defined to include all that had
been purchased of the natives by Minuit and Hollender, extending, on
the west side of the Delaware, from Cape Hinlopen<a name="FNanchor_918_918" id="FNanchor_918_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a> northwards to Sankikan,
and on the east from Narraticons Kil southwards to Cape May.
Over the whole of this region he was commanded to uphold the supremacy
of his sovereign, keeping the Dutch colony under Jost van Bogardt to the
observance of their charter, and bringing the English settlers under subjection,
or procuring their removal, as he deemed best. His relations with
the Holland West India Company and their representatives at Manhattan
and Fort Nassau were to be friendly but independent, and, in case of
hostile encroachments, “force was to be repelled by force.” On the 30th
of August a budget was adopted for New Sweden, specifying, besides the
Governor, a lieutenant, sergeant, corporal, gunner, trumpeter, and drummer,
with twenty-four private soldiers, and (in the civil list) a preacher,
clerk, surgeon, provost, and executioner, their salaries being estimated at
3,020 riksdaler per annum. Fleming and Beier (this year appointed
postmaster-general) had the chief direction of the enterprise, and special
factors were designated for the Company’s service in Gottenburg and
Amsterdam. At length all preparations were completed, and the fourth
Swedish expedition to New Sweden, consisting of the ships “Fama”
(Fame) and “Svanen” (the Swan), set sail from Gottenburg on the 1st
of November, 1642, carrying Printz, with his wife and children, Lieutenant
Måns Kling, the Rev. Johan Campanius Holm, and many others, among
whom were a number of forest-destroying Finns, sent out as formerly by
their respective governors.<a name="FNanchor_919_919" id="FNanchor_919_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a> They pursued the usual course through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
English Channel and past the Canary Islands, spending Christmas with
the hospitable Governor of Antigua; and, after encountering severe
storms, towards the close of January entered Delaware Bay, and on the
15th of February, 1643, landed in safety at Fort Christina.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the first and very full report of the new governor to the
West India Company, dated April 13, 1643, and despatched on the return
voyage of the “Fama,” appears to have been irrecoverably lost; but
in letters addressed the day before and the day after, respectively, to
Councillors Peter Brahe and Axel Oxenstjerna, still preserved in Sweden,
Printz gives a favorable account of the country and an interesting description
of the natives, and earnestly advises the sending out of more emigrants.
Soon after his arrival he made a journey through his territory,
sailing up the Delaware to Sankikan, and determined to take up his abode
on the Island of Tennakong, or Tinicum, situated about fifteen miles
above Christina. Here he built himself a house (Printzhof), and erected
a fort of heavy logs, armed with four brass cannon, called Nya Göteborg
(New Gottenburg),&mdash;a name also bestowed on the whole place in a patent
from his sovereign of the 6th of the following November, granting it “to
him and his lawful issue as a perpetual possession.” About twenty emigrants
settled on this island, with their families, including Printz’s book-keeper
and clerk, with his body-guard and the crew of a little yacht used
by the Governor. A redoubt was likewise constructed “after the English
plan, with three angles,” on the eastern shore, “close to the river,” by a little
stream now known as Mill Creek, three or four miles below Varkens Kil,
which was named Nya Elfsborg.</p>

<p>It was defended by eight brass
twelve-pounders, and committed
to the charge of Lieutenant Sven
Schute and Sergeant Gregorius
van Dyck, with a gunner and drummer and twelve or fifteen common soldiers;
and was already occupied in October, when a Dutch skipper, carrying
David Pieterszen de
Vries on his last voyage
to the Delaware, was
required to strike his
flag in passing the place and give account of his cargo, although the noted
patroon was afterward courteously entertained five days at Tinicum by
Governor Printz, who bought “wines and sweetmeats” of his captain,
and accompanied him on his return as far as Fort Christina.</p>

<p>The latter post remained the chief place of deposit of the stores of the colony
under Commissary Hendrick Huygen, and was settled by about forty
persons and their families, including the Reverend Johan Campanius, a
miller, two carpenters, a few sailors and soldiers, and a dozen peasants,
who were occupied in the cultivation of tobacco. A tobacco plantation
was also formed the same year on the west side of the Delaware, four or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
five miles below Tinicum, under the direction of Peter Liljehöck, assisted
by an experienced tobacco-grower, specially hired for the service, with a
dozen or more husbandmen, and received the name of Upland. About
the same time another was begun by Lieutenant Måns Kling, with seven
or eight colonists, on the Schuylkill. At first both of these places were
destitute of forts, although log houses, strengthened by small stones, were
built for the accommodation of the settlers.<a name="FNanchor_920_920" id="FNanchor_920_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a> A large quantity of maize
was sown by Printz immediately after his arrival for the sustenance of
the colony, but not yielding the results anticipated from certain statements
of Governor Hollender, the deficiency was supplied by purchase of
some cattle and winter rye at the Island of Manhattan. Provisions were
also obtained from Dutch and English vessels which visited the Delaware.
During the autumn, rye was planted in three places, and in the following
spring some barley, which grew so well, says the Governor, “it was delightful
to behold.” For greater convenience of communication between the
scattered settlements two boats were built by the carpenters, one for the
use of Elfsborg, the other for Christina.</p>

<p>Although the instructions to Governor Printz concerning his relations
with the English were probably issued in ignorance of the attempt of Kieft
to dislodge the latter from the Delaware, the success of the Dutch Director-General
does not seem to have been so complete as to render them superfluous.
Lamberton still visited the river for purposes of trade, and a few settlers
from New Haven yet remained at Varkens Kil. Printz, therefore, “went to
the houses” of these English families, and “forced some of them to swear
allegiance to the crown of Sweden.” He also found opportunity of apprehending
Lamberton, and brought him before a tribunal comprising Captains
Christian Boije and Måns Kling, Commissaries Huygen and Jansen, and six
other persons then on the Delaware, assembled in the name of the Swedish
sovereign at Fort Christina, July 10, 1643. Printz met two protests made by
the Englishman at his trial, claiming land on both sides of the river in virtue
of purchases from the Indians, by showing that the territory in question was
embraced in tracts already bought of the savages by Governors Minuit and
Hollender. He also proved to the satisfaction of the court that Lamberton
had traded with the natives in the vicinity even of Fort Christina without
leave and in spite of repeated prohibitions, obtaining a quantity of beaver
skins, for which the defendant was required by the tribunal to pay double
duty. And, finally, Lamberton was accused by the Governor of bribing
the Indians to murder the Swedes and Dutch,&mdash;a charge which was supported
by several witnesses, who also testified that on the day agreed upon
an unusual number of savages had assembled in front of Fort Christina,
who were, however, frightened off before they could attain their purpose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
In passing upon this grave indictment, the court preferred to treat the
defendant with clemency “on this occasion,” and postponed action on the
subject. These decisions naturally did not content Lamberton, and at a
meeting of the Commissioners of the United Colonies of New England,
held at Boston September 7, complaint was made by his associates, Governor
Theophilus Eaton and Thomas Gregson, of “injuries received from
the Dutch and Swedes at Delaware Bay;” when it was “ordered that a letter
be written to the Swedish governor, expressing the particulars and requiring
satisfaction,” to be signed by John Winthrop “as Governor of Massachusetts
and President of the Commissioners.” This resolution was complied
with, and a commission was given to Lamberton “to go treat with” Printz
upon the subject, and “to agree with him about settling their trade and
plantation” on the Delaware. Winthrop’s letter was answered by the Governor
of New Sweden, Jan. 12, 1644, with a statement of the facts established
at his court already mentioned, and a fresh examination of the matter was
instituted on the 16th. This was likewise conducted at Fort Christina, in
the presence of the Governor, Captains Boije, Kling, and Turner, Commissary
Huygen, Sergeant Van Dyck, Isaac Allerton, and Secretary Carl Janson,
and resulted in the exculpation of Printz from the offences charged
against him. Copies of these proceedings and of all others relating to the
New Haven people were transmitted to a General Court of Massachusetts
which met at Boston in March, and Governor Winthrop, in acknowledging
the receipt of them in a friendly letter to Governor Printz, promised “a full
and particular response at the next meeting of the Commissioners of the
United Colonies.” At the same time a fresh commission was issued to
Governor Eaton, though “with a <i>salvo jure</i>, allowing him to go on with his
plantation and trade in Delaware River,” accompanied by a copy of the
Massachusetts patent, which he desired “to show the Swedish governor.”
Certain merchants of Boston likewise obtained the privilege of forming
a company for traffic in the vicinity of a great lake believed to be the
chief source of the beaver trade, which was supposed to lie near the headwaters
of the Delaware; and, to carry out their project, despatched a pinnace,
well manned and laden, to that river, with a commission “under the
public seal,” and letters from the Governor of Massachusetts to Kieft and
Printz for liberty to pass their strongholds. “This,” says Winthrop, “the
Dutch promised” to concede, though under “protest;” but “when they
came to the Swedes, the fort shot at them ere they came up,” obliging
them to cast anchor, “and the next morning the Lieutenant came aboard
and forced them to fall lower down.” On complaint to Governor Printz,
the conduct of that officer was repudiated, and instructions were sent to
him from Tinicum not to molest the expedition. All further progress was,
however, checked by the Dutch agent at Fort Nassau, who showed an order
from his Governor not to let them pass that place; and since neither Printz
nor Kieft would permit them to trade with the Indians, they returned home
“with loss of their voyage.” The letter which Printz addressed to Winthrop,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
explaining his actions on this occasion, dated at Tinicum, June 29, 1644,
is more amiable than truthful; for in the copy sent to the authorities in
Sweden the Governor qualifies his intimation that he promoted the undertaking,
with the statement that he took care that the Dutch at Fort Nassau
brought it to nought, since it was the purpose of the persons who were engaged
in it “to build a fort above the Swedish post at Sankikan, to be armed
with men and cannon, and appropriate to themselves all the profits of the
river.” Not less successful was the opposition of the Governor to an attempt
to invade his territory by the English knight, Sir Edmund Plowden,
who had recently come to America to take possession, in virtue of a grant
from King Charles I. of England, of a large tract of land, in which New
Sweden was included. For though certain of the retainers of this so-styled
“Earl Palatine of New Albion,” who had mutinied and left their
lord to perish on an island, were apprehended at Fort Elfsborg in May,
1643, and courteously surrendered to him by Printz, the latter refused to
permit any vessels trading under his commission to pass up the Delaware,
and so “affronted” Plowden that he finally abandoned the river.<a name="FNanchor_921_921" id="FNanchor_921_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a></p>

<p>The relations between the Swedes and Dutch were seemingly more
friendly. “Ever since I came here,” says Printz in his Report of 1644, “the
Hollanders have shown great amity, particularly their Director at Manhattan,
Willem Kieft, who writes to me very frequently, as he has opportunity,
telling the news from Sweden and Holland and other countries of Europe;
and though at the first he gave me to understand that his West India Company
laid claim to our river, on my replying to him with the best arguments
at my command, he has now for a long while spared me those inflictions.”</p>

<p>The Indians always exhibited the most amicable dispositions towards the
Swedes, partly no doubt through timidity, but at least equally in consequence
of the kind treatment habitually shown them by the colonists of
that nation. Still, in the spring of 1644, influenced, it is presumed, by the
example of their brethren in Virginia and Maryland and the vicinity of
Manhattan, who had recently been provoked to fierce hostility against the
Dutch and English, some of the savages massacred two soldiers and a laborer
between Christina and Elfsborg, and a Swedish woman and her husband
(an Englishman) between Tinicum and Upland. Printz, however,
immediately assembling his people at Christina to defend themselves from
further outrages, the natives “came together,” says he, “from all sides,
heartily apologizing for, and denying all complicity in, the murderous
deeds, and suing earnestly for peace.” This was accorded them by the
Governor, but “with the menace of annihilation if the settlers were ever
again molested.” Whereupon a treaty was signed by the sachems, and
ratified by the customary interchange of presents, assuring tranquillity for
the future and restoring something of the previous mutual confidence.<a name="FNanchor_922_922" id="FNanchor_922_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a></p>

<p>During the six years now elapsed since the founding of New Sweden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
the colonists were compelled to undergo the privations which inevitably
attend the first settlement of a wild and untitled country; and the frequent
scarcity of food and insufficiency of shelter, combined with the novelty and
uncertainty of the climate, and occasional seasons of disease, had the usual
effect of diminishing their numbers. Especially fatal was the last summer,
that of 1643, when no fewer than seventeen (between six and seven per
cent) of the male emigrants died, among these being the Reverend Reorus
Torkillus, the first pastor of the colony.</p>

<p>The need, therefore, for fresh
recruits to take the places of those who proved themselves unequal to the
trials of their situation constantly presented itself to the survivors, and
ought, surely, to have been appreciated by the authorities in Sweden.
Nevertheless, the fifth Swedish expedition to the Delaware, which arrived
at Christina on the “Fama,”<a name="FNanchor_923_923" id="FNanchor_923_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a> March 11, 1644, added very little to the
numerical strength of the settlement;<a name="FNanchor_924_924" id="FNanchor_924_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a> while, through the carelessness of
the agent at Gottenburg,
some of the clothing and
merchandise was shipped
in a damaged condition.</p>

<div class="floatright">

</div>

<p>The principal emigrant on
this occasion was Johan
Papegåja, who had already
been in New Sweden, and now returned, bearing letters of recommendation
to the Governor from his sovereign and from Peter Brahe, President of the
Royal Council, in consequence
of which he
was at once appointed
to the chief command
at Fort Christina. He
was likewise accepted as a suitor for the hand of Printz’s daughter,
Armgott, and not long afterward became the Governor’s son-in-law. Brahe
acknowledged the receipt of Printz’s letter, before referred to, on the 18th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
of August; and congratulating him on his safe arrival at the Delaware he
expresses the hope that he will “gain firm foothold there, and be able to
lay so good a foundation <i>in tam vasta terra septentrionali</i>, that with God’s
gracious favor the whole North American continent may in time be brought
to the knowledge of His Son, and become subject to the crown of Sweden.”
He particularly admonishes the Governor to cultivate friendship with “the
poor savages,” instructing them, and endeavoring to convert them to Christianity.
“Adorn,” says he, “your little church and priest after the Swedish
fashion, with the usual habiliments of the altar, in distinction from the Hollanders
and English, shunning all leaven of Calvinism,” remembering that
“outward ceremonial will not the less move them than others to sentiments
of piety and devotion.” He likewise enjoins “the use of the Swedish language
in spoken and written discourse, in all its purity, without admixture
of foreign tongues. All rivers and streams, forests, and other places should
receive old Swedish names, to the exclusion of the nomenclature of the
Dutch, which,” he has heard, “is taking root. In fine,” he adds, “let the
manners and customs of the colony conform as closely as possible to those
of Sweden.” To Printz’s reply to this letter we are indebted for the fullest
account of the religious rites observed in the settlement which has been
preserved to us. “Divine service,” says the Governor, “is performed here
in the good old Swedish tongue, our priest clothed in the vestments of the
Mass on high festivals, solemn prayer-days, Sundays, and Apostles’ days
precisely as in old Sweden, and differing in every respect from that of the
sects around us. Sermons are delivered Wednesdays and Fridays, and on
all other days prayers are offered in the morning and afternoon; and since
this cannot be done everywhere by our sole clergyman, I have appointed a
lay-reader for each place, to say prayers daily, morning and evening, and
dispose the people to godliness. All this,” he continues, “has long been
witnessed by the savages, some of whom we have had several days with us,
attempting to convert them; but they have watched their chance, and invariably
run off to rejoin their pagan brethren,”&mdash;a statement not inconsistent
with the testimony of Campanius, who admits that, although his grandfather
held many conversations with the Indians, and translated the Swedish
Lutheran catechism into their language<a name="FNanchor_925_925" id="FNanchor_925_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a> for their instruction in Christian
doctrine, no more definite result was reached than to convince them of the
relative superiority of the religion thus expounded.</p>

<p>In the course of three months a cargo was obtained for the return voyage
of the “Fama,” consisting of 2,142 beaver skins, 300 of which were
from the Schuylkill, and 20,467 pounds of tobacco, part being bought in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
Virginia, while the rest was raised by the Swedes and their English neighbors
at Varkens Kil, Printz allowing a higher price for this, to encourage
the cultivation of the plant and to induce immigration to New Sweden.
The Governor also freighted the vessel with 7,300 pounds on his personal
account. Five of the colonists embraced this opportunity to go back
to Sweden, among whom were Captain Boije, the clergyman “Herr Israel,”
and a barber-surgeon. The “Fama” set sail on the 20th of June, and
reached Europe in the autumn, but putting into a Dutch harbor to revictual
was detained there pending a long controversy as to the payment of duty
between Peter Spiring, then Swedish Resident at the Hague, and the States-General,
and did not arrive at Gottenburg till May, 1645.</p>

<p>At the date of Governor Printz’s second Report to the Swedish West
India Company, which was sent home by the “Fama,” the colonists in New
Sweden numbered ninety men, besides women and children. About half
of these were employed, at stipulated wages, in the discharge of various
civil and military functions on behalf of the Crown and Company. The
“freemen” (<i>frimännen</i>)&mdash;so called because they had settled in the colony
entirely of their own will, and might leave it at their option&mdash;held land
granted them in fee, temporarily not taxed, which they cultivated for themselves,
being aided also by the Company with occasional gifts of money,
food, and raiment. Persons who had been compelled to immigrate, as elsewhere
stated, in punishment for offences committed by them in Sweden,
were required to till ground reserved to the Company, which fed and clothed
them, or to perform other work, at the discretion of the Governor, for a few
years, when they were admitted to the privileges of freemen, or assigned
duty in the first class above mentioned.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1644 a bark was sent by the merchants of Boston
to trade in the Delaware, which passed the winter near the English plantation
at Varkens Kil, and the following spring fell down the bay, and in
three weeks secured five hundred skins of the Indians on the Maryland
side. Just as the vessel was about to leave, she was treacherously boarded
by some of the savages, who rifled her of her goods and sails, killing the
master and three men, and taking two prisoners, who were brought six
weeks afterward to Governor Printz, and were returned by him to New
England.</p>

<p>On the 25th of November, 1645, a grievous calamity befell the colony in
the burning of New Gottenburg, which was set on fire, between ten and
eleven o’clock at night, by a gunner, who was tried and sentenced by Printz,
and subsequently sent to Sweden for punishment. “The whole place was
consumed,” says the Governor, “in a single hour, nought being rescued but
the dairy;” the loss to the Company amounting to four thousand riksdaler.
“The people escaped, naked and destitute; but the winter immediately setting
in with great severity, and the river and creeks freezing, they were cut
off from communication with the mainland,” and barely avoided starvation
until relief arrived in March. Printz continued, however, to reside at Tinicum,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
and soon rebuilt a storehouse, to receive “provisions and cargoes to
be sold on behalf of the Company.” He also erected a church upon the
island, “decorating it,” says he, “so far as our resources would permit,
after the Swedish fashion,” which, with its adjoining burying-ground, was
consecrated by Campanius, Sept. 4, 1646.</p>

<div class="floatright">
     <img src="images/ill-461.jpg" width="200" height="72" id="i461"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>In the summer of the same year occurred the first outbreak of the
jealousy which had existed from the beginning between the Swedes and
Hollanders, however well it may have been concealed, especially during
the need of concerted action against their common rival the English. On
the 23d of June a sloop arrived at
Fort Nassau with a cargo from
Manhattan, to trade with the
Indians, and was directed by
Andries Hudde, the Dutch commissary who had succeeded
Jan Jansen, “to go into the Schuylkill.” She was
immediately commanded by the Swedes to leave the place,&mdash;an order
which was repeated to Hudde, and reiterated the next day by Campanius.
The result was a conference between the Dutch commissary and Commissary
Huygen, Sergeant Van Dyck, and Carl Janson, on behalf of Printz;
which was followed on the 1st of July by so menacing an admonition
from the Governor, that Jurriaen Blanck the supercargo, fearing his vessel
and goods might be confiscated, felt constrained to yield, and abandoned
his enterprise. Soon afterward Hudde was prevented from executing a
commission of Director Kieft, to search for minerals at Sankikan, through
the opposition of the Indians, prompted by a report of the warlike intentions
of the Hollanders circulated among the savages by Printz. And when,
in September, in obedience to instructions from Manhattan, the Dutch
commissary purchased from the natives land on the “west shore” of the
Delaware, “distant about one league to the north of Fort Nassau” (within
the limits of the present city of Philadelphia), and erected the arms of his
West India Company upon it, these were pulled down “in a hostile manner,”
on the 8th of October, by Commissary Huygen, and a protest against
his action was delivered to him on the 16th by Olof Stille and Mans Slom,
on the part of the Swedish governor. The latter likewise forbade his
people to have any dealings with the Hollanders, and treated a counter-protest,
sent to him by Hudde on the 23d, with such contempt as effectually
completed the rupture.</p>

<p>It was now two years and three months since the “Fama” left the Delaware,
during the whole of which time no letters were received in the colony
either from Sweden or from Holland. This apparent neglect of her offspring
by the mother country was accounted for by Chancellor Oxenstjerna
through the occurrence of the war with Denmark, which absorbed the
attention of the Government and cost the life of Admiral Fleming, who
had been the chief administrator of the interests of the settlement. Not
until the 1st of October, 1646, did the sixth Swedish expedition arrive in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
New Sweden, on the ship “Gyllene Hajen” (the Golden Shark), after a
tempestuous voyage of four months, in which the vessel lost her sails, topmasts,
and other rigging, and the crew almost to a man fell sick. Few, if
any, emigrants came out on this voyage; but the cargo was valuable, comprising
cloth, iron implements, and other goods, which supplied the needs
of the settlers, with something to spare for sale in New England. Printz
was also enabled to revive his languishing trade with the Indians. He
“immediately despatched Commissary Hendrick Huygen, with Sergeant
Gregorius van Dyck and eight soldiers, to the country of the Minquas,
distant five German miles, who presented the savages with divers gifts,
and induced them to agree to traffic with the Swedes as formerly, particularly,”
says the Governor, “as the Commissary promised them higher prices
than they could get from the Hollanders.” On the 20th of February,
1647, the vessel sailed on her return, carrying 24,177 pounds of tobacco,
of which 6,920 pounds were raised on the Delaware, while the rest was
purchased elsewhere. Lieutenant Papegåja went home in her, commissioned
to execute some private behests of the colonists, and to present the
Governor’s third Report to the Swedish West India Company.</p>

<p>In the document referred to, dated at New Gottenburg the day “Gyllene
Hajen” left, Printz gives a very satisfactory account of the settlement,
which, he says, at that time numbered one hundred and eighty-three souls.
“The people,” he adds, “have always enjoyed good health, only two men
and two young children having died” since the second Report. “Twenty-eight
freemen were settled, and beginning to prosper; many more being willing
to follow their example if they could be spared from the fortified posts.”
Of these, Fort Elfsborg had been considerably strengthened; Fort Christina,
which was quite decayed, repaired from top to bottom; and Fort Nya
Korsholm, on the Schuylkill, was nearly ready for use. This last was
doubtless the structure called by Campanius “Manaijung, Skörkilen,”<a name="FNanchor_926_926" id="FNanchor_926_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a>&mdash;“a
fine little fort of logs, filled in with sand and stones, and surrounded by
palisades with sharp points at the top.” “I have also built,” says Printz,
“on the other side of Korsholm, by the path of the Minquas, a fine
house called Wasa,<a name="FNanchor_927_927" id="FNanchor_927_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a> capable of defence against the savages by four or
five men; and seven stout freemen have settled there. And a quarter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
a mile farther up the same Indian highway I have erected another strong
house, settling five freemen in the vicinity,&mdash;this place receiving the name
of Mölndal, from a water-mill I have had constructed, which runs the whole
year, to the great advantage of the country; especially,” adds he, “as the
windmill, which was here before I came, was good for nothing, and never
would work.” Both of these posts the natives were obliged to pass in
going to Fort Nassau; and the Swedish governor hoped, by storing them
with merchandise for barter, to intercept the traffic with the Dutch. Printz
insists upon the need of getting rid of the latter, accusing them of ruining
his trade, and supplying the savages with ammunition, and inciting them
against the Swedes. “The English Puritans,” he continues, “who gave me
a great deal of trouble at first, I have been able finally to drive away; and
for a long time have heard nothing from them, except that last year Captain
Clerk, through his agent from New England, attempted to settle some
hundred families here under our flag, which I civilly declined to permit
until further instructed in the matter by her Majesty.” The Governor
earnestly solicits the sending of more people from Sweden, particularly
“families to cultivate the country,” artisans and soldiers, “and, above all,
unmarried women as wives for the unmarried freemen and others.” He
likewise mentions the names of several officers who wished to be allowed to
return home, and desires himself to be relieved, especially as he had been
in New Sweden more than a year and a half beyond the term agreed
upon.</p>

<p>Printz’s Report and Papegåja’s representations seem to have hastened
the sending of another vessel to the Delaware, for on the 25th of September,
1647, the seventh expedition sailed from Gottenburg on “Svanen,”
Captain Steffen Willemsen. Papegåja returned on the ship, bearing a letter
of commendation from Queen Christina to Governor Printz, promising to
consider a request of the latter for augmentation of his salary and a grant
of “seventy farms,”<a name="FNanchor_928_928" id="FNanchor_928_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_928_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a> but requiring him to remain in the colony until his
place could be supplied.</p>

<p>A great deal of the ammunition asked for by the Governor was sent
out on this vessel, but very few emigrants,<a name="FNanchor_929_929" id="FNanchor_929_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_929_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a>&mdash;a circumstance which was
explained, in a communication from Chancellor Oxenstjerna in reply to
Printz’s Report, by the near approach of winter. Action was likewise
taken some months later by the Crown making good the deficiency of
the South Company through payment of the salaries of its officers in
New Sweden,&mdash;a burden which had been temporarily assumed by it in
consequence of the misappropriations, as well as insufficiency, of the
tobacco excises which had been granted towards that object by statute of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
the 30th of August, 1642. And by the same royal letter, dated Jan. 20,
1648, merchandise coming from Holland for transportation to New Sweden
was freed from duty, as also tobacco and furs which arrived in the kingdom
from the colony. On the 16th of the following May “Svanen”
set out again from the Delaware, and after a remarkably quick
voyage arrived on the 3d of July
at Stockholm. The clergyman
Johan Campanius
Holm
returned in
her, and Lieutenant Papegåja wrote to
Chancellor Oxenstjerna, begging the favor of a position
in Sweden, since the people in New Sweden were too inconsiderable
for him to be of any service to the company where he was, and “the country
was troublesome to defend, both on account of the savages and of the
Christians, who inflict upon us,” says he, “every kind of injury.”</p>

<p>This complaint is evidently directed against the Hollanders, who now
began to strengthen their position on the Delaware. Willem Kieft, so
amiably pacific in his comportment towards the Swedes, was superseded in
the government of New Netherland in May, 1647, by Peter Stuyvesant,&mdash;a
man of arbitrary and warlike character, who declared it to be his intention
to regard as Dutch territory not only New Sweden, but all land between
Cape Henlopen and Cape Cod. Meanwhile, Governor Printz persisted in
a haughty demeanor towards the Dutch, continuing to impede or prevent
their navigation of the “South River,” and he is charged with inciting suspicion
of his rivals among both Indians and Christians,&mdash;actions which
were protested against by Stuyvesant, to whom the Swedish governor
made a reply which was transmitted to Manhattan by Commissary Hudde
in December. During the winter Printz collected a great quantity of logs
for the purpose of erecting more buildings at the Schuylkill; and when
in the spring Hudde, instigated by the natives, constructed a fort called
Beversrede at Passajung, Lieutenant Kling opposed the work, and ordered
his men, some twenty-four in number, to cut down the trees around the
spot. On news of this, and in consequence of a complaint of the Directors
of the Dutch West India Company that the limits between the Swedes,
English, and Hollanders were still unsettled, Councillors Lubbertus van
Dincklagen and Johannes la Montagne, despatched by Stuyvesant on that
mission in June, procured from the natives confirmation of a grant of land
on the Schuylkill made to Arendt Corssen on behalf of the Dutch in 1633,
and, visiting New Gottenburg, protested before the Governor against the
actions of the Swedes. No attention was paid to this, however, and houses
which two Dutchmen immediately began to build upon the tract were
destroyed by Printz’s son (Gustaf Printz) and Sergeant Van Dyck. In
September the Governor caused a house to be built within a dozen feet of
Fort Beversrede, and directly between it and the river, while Lieutenant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
Sven Schute prevented the construction of houses by the Hollanders in
November. Another Dutchman obtained permission from Director-General
Stuyvesant to settle on the east side of the Delaware, at Mantaes Hoeck
(near the present Mantua Creek, New Jersey), and solicited the aid of Governor
Printz in carrying out his purpose. This was promised him, provided
he acknowledged the jurisdiction of that officer; but, fearing some advantage
might be taken of the concession by the Hollanders, Printz immediately
bought from the Indians the land between this place and Narraticons
Kil, which constituted the northern boundary of the purchase of Governor
Hollender, and erected the Swedish arms upon it. According to Hudde,
the Governor of New Sweden likewise endeavored to acquire from the
natives territory about Fort Nassau, more completely to isolate that place
from intercourse with Manhattan, but was anticipated by the Dutch, who
secured it for themselves in April, 1649.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the mother country an expedition was preparing, which
but for its untimely fate would have furnished the colony with such ample
means of security and self-defence as might very probably have postponed
or even altogether prevented the ultimate subjugation of the latter by the
Hollanders. On the 24th of March, 1649, Queen Christina issued orders to
the College of the Admiralty to equip the “Kalmar Nyckel,” then lying at
Gottenburg, for the projected voyage across the ocean; and finding it would
take too long to get her ready, on the 13th of April her Majesty authorized
the substitution of the
ship “Kattan” (the Cat),
under the command of
Captain Cornelius Lucifer.
A certain Hans Amundson
Besk was appointed
leader of this, the eighth,
Swedish expedition to New Sweden, which comprised his wife and five
children, and sixty-three other emigrants, including a clergyman, clerk,
and barber-surgeon, many mechanics, and some soldiers, with sixteen unmarried
women, designed no doubt as wives for the earlier settlers. The
fact that three hundred Finns applied for the privilege of joining the party
showed there was no lack of voluntary colonists. The cargo embraced implements
of every sort, and a large quantity of the materials of war,&mdash;“two
six-pounder brass cannon, two three-pounder, twelve six-pounder, and two
four-pounder iron cannon, powder, lead, grenades, muskets, pistols,” and so
forth, besides rigging for a ship to be built on the Delaware. The vessel
sailed on the 3d of July from Gottenburg, and arrived in safety at the West
Indies, where, through the carelessness of the captain, on the 26th of August
she struck a rock near an island fourteen miles from Porto Rico. When
ready to set out afresh, the emigrants were pillaged by the inhabitants, who
were Spaniards, and were taken to the latter place, where certain of them
permanently settled, while others contrived in the course of one or two years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
to get back to Sweden. Eighteen, only, determined to continue their voyage
to the Delaware, leaving Porto Rico with that intention in a little bark
which they were able to purchase, May 1, 1651. They were seized the very
next day, however, by a frigate, which carried them to Santa Cruz, then in
the possession of France, where they were most barbarously treated by
the Governor and his people. In a few weeks all died but five, who were
taken off by a Dutch vessel, of whom a single survivor finally reached
Holland. Commander Amundson and his family were sent by the Governor
of Porto Rico to Spain, where they arrived in July of the same year,
and whence they afterward proceeded to Amsterdam, and at last returned
to Sweden.</p>

<p>This expedition, therefore, effected nothing for the colonists on the Delaware,
who must have been greatly depressed by the news of its calamities.
This reached them, through a letter of Director-General Stuyvesant to
Commissary Hudde, on the 6th of August, 1650 (N. S.).<a name="FNanchor_930_930" id="FNanchor_930_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_930_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a> Printz immediately
wrote by a Dutch vessel to Peter Brahe, referring to the report, and
giving some account of the settlement since the departure of “Svanen,”
two years and three months before. “Most of the people,” says he, “are
alive and well. They are generally supplied with oxen and cattle, and cultivate
the land with assiduity, sowing rye and barley, and planting orchards
of delicious fruit, and would do better if all had wives and servants. Last
year the crops were particularly excellent, our freemen having a hundred
tuns of grain to sell. In short, the governor who relieves me will find his
position as good as any similar one in Sweden. I have taken possession
of the best places, and still hold them. Notwithstanding repeated acts and
protests of the Dutch, nothing whatever has been accomplished by them;
and where, on several occasions, they attempted to build within our boundaries,
I at once threw down their work: so that, if the new governor brings
enough people with him, they will very soon grow weary and disgusted,
like the Puritans, who were most violent at first, but now leave us entirely
in peace. This year, however, they had all the trade, since we received no
cargoes; and so long as this is the case we must entertain some fear of the
savages, although as yet we have experienced no hostility from them.”
Further details as to the condition of the colony were to be orally communicated
to the authorities in Sweden by Lieutenant Sven Schute, who
was sent home for that purpose. Printz earnestly renewed his appeal to
be released, urging his age and great feebleness, and recalling the services
he had rendered to his country during the past thirty years.</p>

<p>So determined had been the opposition of the Governor to the encroachments
of the Hollanders, that the Directors of the Dutch West India Company
now began to think of applying to Queen Christina for a settlement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
of limits between the rival jurisdictions,&mdash;a purpose they communicated
to the Director-General of New Netherland in a letter of the 21st of March,
1651, meantime requiring him, however, to “endeavor to maintain the rights
of the Company in all justice and equity.” In accordance with these instructions,
and in consequence, it is likely, of Printz’s fresh interference in the
spring with operations of the Dutch in the neighborhood of Fort Beversrede
and on an island in the Schuylkill, the energetic Stuyvesant despatched
“a ship, well manned and equipped with cannon,” from New
Amsterdam, which made
her appearance at the
mouth of the Delaware
on the 8th of the following
May, and “dropping
anchor half a (Swedish)
mile below Fort Christina,
closed the river to navigation
of all vessels, large
and small.”</p>

<p>She was, to
be sure, soon forced to
withdraw by an armed
yacht made ready by
Printz; but her captain
sending tidings of his situation
to Manhattan, on
the 25th of June Stuyvesant
himself came overland,
with a hundred and
twenty men, being joined
at Fort Nassau by eleven
sail (including four well-furnished
ships), and after
proceeding up and down
the river several times,
with demonstrations of
hostility, finally landed two
hundred of his soldiers at
a place on the west bank
between Forts Christina
and Elfsborg, called Sandhoeck (near New Castle, Delaware), where he
built a small fort, to which he gave the name of Casimir. He likewise
cut down the Swedish boundary posts, and sought by threats to compel the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
freemen to acknowledge the rule of the Hollanders. Abandoning and
razing Fort Nassau, because of its less convenient position (too far up the
stream), he stationed two men-of-war at his new fort, and collected toll of
foreign vessels, even plundering and detaining several Virginia barques on
account of duty demanded on their traffic in New Sweden for the previous
four years. Printz was not strong enough to resist these acts by force; but
when the Dutch director-general found some Indians ready to deny the
rights of the Swedes, and even to undertake to sell to him the territory
which he had seized, the Governor held a meeting on the 3d of July at
Elfsborg with the heirs of the sachem who had conveyed to Governor
Minuit the land between Christina and Bomtiens Udden, embracing the site
of Fort Casimir, and obtained a confirmation of that grant, with a denial of
the title of the savages who disposed of it to Stuyvesant. A protest was
addressed to the latter from New Gottenburg on the 8th, claiming this region
as well as that above Christina to Sankikan, and appealing for observance
of “the praiseworthy alliance between her Royal Majesty of Sweden
and the High and Mighty States-General.” Similar conferences were likewise
held at New Gottenburg on the 13th and the 16th of the same month,
resulting in still more explicit recognition, on the part of the natives, of
the right of the Swedes to the territory on the Delaware; but neither this
action of the savages nor a personal visit of Printz produced any effect
on the Dutch director-general, although, it is said, at his departure the
rival governors mutually promised to maintain “neighborly friendship and
correspondence,” and to “refrain from hostile or vexatious deeds against
each other.” The Governor of New Sweden related these events in letters
of the 1st of August to Chancellor Oxenstjerna and Councillor Brahe,
saying that he had been obliged to abandon all save his three principal
posts (New Gottenburg, Nya Korsholm, and Christina), which he had
strengthened and reinforced. In other respects the colony had prospered,
reaping “very fine harvests at all the settlements, besides obtaining delicious
crops of several kinds of fruit” that year. “Nothing is needed,” he
adds, “but a much larger emigration of people, both soldiers and farmers,
whom the country is now amply able to sustain.”</p>

<p>Although the Director-General of New Netherland had informed Printz
that his invasion of New Sweden was authorized by the States of Holland,
this was not precisely true; and the Directors of the Dutch West India
Company, in a letter of the 4th of April, 1652, expressed considerable surprise
at the boldness of his action, fearing it might be resented by her
Swedish Majesty. The subject was, in fact, discussed by the Royal Council
of Sweden on the 18th of March, when “the Queen declared it to be
her opinion that redress might fairly be required of the States-General, and
the Chancellor of the Kingdom deemed the question well worthy of deliberation.”
Two days before, also, a consultation was held on the condition
of New Sweden, at which were present, by special summons, Postmaster-General
Beier (who, since the death of Admiral Fleming, acted as superintendent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
of the enterprise in Sweden), the book-keeper Hans Kramer (a
zealous co-operator in the work), Henrik Gerdtson (only known as having
been a resident of New Netherland), the
assessor in the College of Commerce, and
finally Lieutenant Schute, who gave a
good report of the colony and the
resources of the country, and attested
the need of a greater number
of emigrants. Of these, it was stated, plenty could be
found “willing to go forth and settle;” and, in accordance with
the judgment of the Queen and the sentiments of her Chancellor,
it was resolved to commit the undertaking for the future to the care of the
College of Commerce, and to order the Admiralty to prepare a vessel for
another expedition to the Delaware. A few days later a ship was designated
by her Majesty, namely, “Svanen,” but more than a whole year elapsed
before the final execution of the project.</p>

<div class="floatright">
     <img src="images/ill-469.jpg" width="200" height="106" id="i469"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>The situation of the colony, meanwhile, awakened great anxiety in
the mind of the Governor. Not since the arrival of “Svanen,” between
four and five years before, had any message or letter been received from
Sweden, and the emigrants naturally began to fear that they had been abandoned
by their sovereign. Some of them, therefore, left the country, while
others were disposed to do so on a more favorable opportunity. According
to a letter from Printz to Chancellor Oxenstjerna, dated Aug. 30,
1652, forty Dutch families had settled on the east side of the Delaware,
although, like the rest of their compatriots in New Sweden, they were
miserably provided for the pursuit of agriculture, and could only sustain
themselves by traffic with the savages. In the latter particular, however,
both Hollanders and English had great advantages over the Swedes, who
having no cargoes of their own were forced to buy merchandise for barter
of their rivals at double prices, or entirely lose their trade. This year,
unfortunately, “the water spoiled the grain;” still, says Printz, the country
“was in tolerably good condition, the freemen, with their cattle and other
possessions, doing well, and the principal places being occupied and fortified
as usual.” A vessel also had been built, of ninety or a hundred läster,<a name="FNanchor_931_931" id="FNanchor_931_931"></a><a href="#Footnote_931_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a> and
was only waiting for sails and rigging, and some cannon, which cost too
dear to purchase there. On the 26th of April, 1653, the Governor again
wrote to the Chancellor, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The people yet living and remaining in New Sweden, men, women, and children,
number altogether two hundred souls. The settled families do well, and are supplied
with cattle. The country yields a fair revenue. Still the soldiers and others in the
Company’s service enjoy but a very mean subsistence, and consequently seek opportunity
every day to get away, whether with or without leave, having no expectation of
any release, as it is now five years and a half since a letter was received from home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
The English trade, from which we used to obtain a good support, is at an end, on
account of the war with Holland; while the fur-trade yields no profit, particularly now
that hostilities have broken out between the Arrigahaga and Susquehanna Indians,
from whom the beavers were procured. The Hollanders have quit all their places on
the river except Fort Casimir, where they have settled about twenty-six families. To
attempt anything against them with our present resources, however, would be of no
avail. More people must be sent over from Sweden, or all the money and labor
hitherto expended on this undertaking, so well begun, is wasted. We have always
been on peaceful terms with the natives so long as our cargoes lasted, but whenever
these gave out their friendship has cooled; for which reason, as well as for the sustenance
of our colonists, we have been compelled to purchase a small cargo, by
drawing a bill to be paid in Holland, which we expect to discharge by bartering
half of the goods for tobacco.”</p>

<p class="p1">Finally, on the 14th of July, Governor Printz wrote once more to Brahe
concerning a speculation of the Dutch and English for supplying tobacco
for Sweden, through the aid of a Virginia merchant sailing under a Swedish
commission; and, to give further weight
to his appeals on behalf of the colony,
he sent home his son, Gustaf Printz, who
had been a lieutenant in the settlement
since 1648. The situation of the emigrants
did not improve during the summer; and
nothing yet being heard from Sweden, the Governor
felt he could wait no longer, and determined to leave
the country. When this resolution became known, some of the Swedes
were inclined to remove to Manhattan and put themselves under the protection
of Stuyvesant; but being refused permission by the Director-General
until instructions should come from Holland, they seem to have
abandoned the project. Before taking his departure, Printz promised the
inhabitants that he would either himself return in ten months or send back
a vessel and cargo, and appointed in his place, as Vice-Governor of the
Colony, his son-in-law Johan Papegåja. In company with his wife and
Hendrick Huygen, and some others of the settlers, he left the Delaware
in the beginning of October, and, crossing the ocean in a Dutch vessel, by
the 1st of December reached Rochelle, from whence he went to Holland
early in 1654, and in April of that year at last arrived in Sweden.</p>

</div>

<p>The reiterated appeals of Governor Printz to his superiors had begun
at length to produce their effect, and Aug. 13, 1653, Queen Christina
ordered the Admiralty to equip the ship “Vismar” for the expedition to
New Sweden which had been projected (and for which “Svanen” had been
selected) the previous year. Three hundred persons were to take part in
it, and rigging was to be procured for the vessel which had been built on
the Delaware. The same day, also, the College of War was enjoined to
supply ammunition for the defence of the settlement. The College of
Commerce, which was now fully organized, had, by her Majesty’s desire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
assumed the direction of the colony, and the honor of restoring and
actively conducting its affairs belongs to the President of that College,
Erik, son of Axel, Oxenstjerna.</p>

</div>

<p>On the 25th of August Sven Schute was
commanded to enrol fifty soldiers as
emigrants, preferring such as possessed
mechanical skill, sending them
to Stockholm, besides two hundred
and fifty persons, including some women, to be obtained in the forests of
Värmland and Dal. Instead of the “Vismar,” the ship “Örnen” (the
Eagle) was supplied by the Admiralty, which was ready to receive her
cargo by autumn, and was put under the command of Johan Bockhorn,
the mate of the ill-fated “Kattan;” while the West India Company fitted
out “Gyllene Hajen,” which had borne the sixth expedition to New Sweden,
to be commanded by Hans Amundson, who, as Captain of the Navy,
was to superintend the construction of vessels and have charge of the
defences of the colony. Schute was to accompany the expedition as “Captain
in the country, and particularly over the emigrants to be sent out on
‘Örnen,’” both he and Amundson having been granted patents for land
on the Delaware.<a name="FNanchor_932_932" id="FNanchor_932_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_932_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Not aware that Printz had already left New Sweden, the
Queen wrote a letter, December 12, permitting him to come home, but
deprecating his doing so until arrangements
could be made in regard to his
successor; and the same day Johan Claesson
Rising, the Secretary of the College
of Commerce, was appointed Commissary
and Assistant-Councillor to the
Governor, at an annual salary of twelve
hundred daler-silfver, besides receiving
fifteen hundred daler-silfver for the expenses of his voyage, with the privilege
of resuming his position in the College if he returned to Sweden.</p>

<div class="floatright">

</div>

<p>He was also granted as much land in New Sweden as he could cultivate with
twenty or thirty peasants, and received a Memoir from his sovereign, as
well as Instructions from the College of
Commerce, in twenty-four articles, signed
by Erik Oxenstjerna and Christer Bonde
on the 15th, prescribing his duties in
the colony. He was to aid Printz in
the administration of justice and the
promotion of agriculture, trade, fishing, and so forth; and to endeavor to
extend the settlement, encouraging the immigration of worthy neighbors of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
other nations. The Dutch were to be peacefully removed from Fort Casimir
and the vicinity, if possible, care being taken that the English did not
obtain a foothold on the Delaware; and a fort might be built, if needed, at
the mouth of the river. On the way to America another commission was to
be executed by Captain Amundson, in obtaining from the Spaniards at
Porto Rico compensation for “Kattan.”</p>

</div>

<p>The final preparations for the
departure of the ninth expedition
to New Sweden were made
under the directions of the
book-keeper Hans Kramer, in
Stockholm, and Admiral Thijssen
Anckerhelm at Gottenburg,
where “Örnen” remained
for several months awaiting the
arrival of “Gyllene Hajen” from the capital. This did not occur, however,
until the close of January, 1654; and the ship having met with such disasters
at Öresund as necessitated her stopping for repairs before she could
continue her journey, “Örnen” was forced to sail alone. On the 27th of
that month the emigrants, numbering (with women and children) three
hundred and fifty souls, swore allegiance to their sovereign and to the
West India Company, and on February 2 weighed anchor for the Delaware.
No fewer than a hundred families, who had sold all their property
in expectation of uniting in the expedition, were obliged to stay behind for
lack of room. Besides Commissary Rising and Captain Schute, Elias Gyllengren,
who had accompanied Governor Printz to New Sweden, sailed on
this vessel, with the commission of lieutenant.</p>

<div class="floatright">
     <img src="images/ill-472b.jpg" width="250" height="148" id="i472b"

</div>

<p>Two Lutheran clergymen,
Petrus Hjort and Matthias Nertunius, the latter of whom had embarked
on the unfortunate “Kattan,” and Peter Lindström, a
military engineer, from whose letters,
journal, and maps we derive much
information concerning the Swedish
colony, likewise were of the company.
After a very adventurous voyage, during which half of the
travellers fell sick, and the ship was dismantled by a violent
hurricane, and nearly captured by the Turks, “Örnen” arrived
on the 18th of May in Delaware Bay, and two days afterward at Fort
Elfsborg, now deserted and in ruins. On the 21st she cast anchor off Fort
Casimir, then in charge of Gerrit Bikker and a dozen Dutch soldiers. Although
in the general instructions of his superiors Rising was cautioned
against engaging in hostilities with the Hollanders, such was not the personal
counsel of Axel Oxenstjerna; and a letter of Erik Oxenstjerna, dated
Jan. 18, 1654, expresses the opinion that the present was “an opportunity
for action which it were culpable to neglect.” This probably accounts
for the energy exhibited by the Commissary in inaugurating his administration
of the affairs of the colony; for, immediately on reaching the Dutch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
post, he sent Captain Schute with twenty soldiers to demand the surrender
of the garrison. Not receiving a satisfactory reply, the Captain ordered
Lieutenant Gyllengren to enter the place, where the latter soon triumphantly
displayed the Swedish flag. The stronghold was named anew
from the day of its capture (Trinity Sunday), Trefaldighets Fort (Trinity
Fort). The next day “Örnen” sailed up to Christina, and on the 23d
the inhabitants of that region assembled to hear the commands of their
sovereign, and the Dutch settlers who were permitted to remain on the
Delaware took the oath of fealty to Sweden,&mdash;an act which, with the
surrender of Fort Casimir, was at once reported in a letter from Rising to
Stuyvesant.</p>

<p>A meeting of the
rest of the people
for the same
object was held
at Tinicum on
the 4th of June.
Since the departure

Printz the
colonists had
been greatly reduced

causes, and Fort
Nya Korsholm
had been abandoned,
and had

burned by the
savages. Lieutenant

therefore, cheerfully
resigned the
responsibility of the government to Commissary Rising, who retained him,
however, as his counsellor, in conjunction with Captain Schute.</p>

<p>The new Governor spent several days in visiting the various settlements
on the river, in company with Engineer Lindström, and on the 17th of
June concluded a treaty of peace and friendship with the Indians, represented
by ten of their sachems, at a council at Printzhof. The day after,
“Lawrence Lloyd, the English commandant of Virginia,” took supper with
Rising, and intimated the claim made by his nation to the Delaware, referring
especially to the grant to Plowden, already spoken of. The Swedes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
defended their title to the territory by an appeal to the donations and concessions
of the natives. The Virginians subsequently desiring to buy land
and settle it with colonists, Rising, remembering the encroachments of the
Puritans in New Netherland, felt constrained to deny their request until
special instructions on the subject should be received from Sweden. On
the other hand, an open letter was addressed by the Governor, July 3, to
all Swedes who had gone to Virginia, inviting them to return to the Delaware,
and promising that they should then be granted permission to betake
themselves wherever they wished. On the 8th of the same month still
further recognition of the Swedish dominion over the west shore of the
river, from Fort Trinity to the Schuylkill, was obtained from two Indian
chieftains, who met Rising for that purpose at Fort Christina. The relations
with New England at this period were quite friendly, and a shallop
was despatched thither, under the charge of Jacob Svenson, to procure a
larger supply of food. At the same time an “Ordinance” was promulgated,
determining many details “concerning the people, land, agriculture,
woods, and cattle,” designed to promote the internal welfare of the colony.
The progress made during the first two months of Governor Rising’s administration
was very satisfactory; and hopeful letters were addressed by him,
July 11 and 13, to Erik and Axel Oxenstjerna, respectively, and a full
Report of measures recommended and adopted, bearing the latter date,
was rendered to the College of Commerce. “For myself,” says the Governor,
“thank God, I am very contented. There is four times more ground
occupied at present than when we arrived, and the country is better peopled;
for then we found only seventy persons, and now, including the
Hollanders and others, there are three hundred and sixty-eight.” Some of
the old freemen, induced by the immunity from taxation which had been
accorded to persons who occupied new land, requested fresh allotments.
These relinquished ground already cleared, which was purchased for the
Company and settled with young freemen, who were supplied with seed
and cattle, subject to an equal division with the Company of the offspring
and of the crops. Rising also deemed it advisable to found a little town of
artisans and mechanics, and for that purpose selected a field near Fort
Christina, which Lindström laid out in lots, naming the place Christinahamn
(Christina Haven), where he proposed “to build houses in the
autumn;” and among sites for cities and villages he mentions Sandhoeck,
or Trinity, where about twenty-two houses had been erected by the Hollanders.
The Dutch fort at the latter spot, which he had captured,
was reconstructed by Captain Schute, who armed it with four fourteen-pounder
cannon taken from “Örnen.” In accordance with the permission
granted, Rising selected for himself a piece of “uncleared land below Fort
Trinity;” and since this was rather remote from his place of residence,
Christina, he requested the privilege of cultivating “Timmerön (Timber
Island), with the land to Skölpaddkilen (Tortoise-shell Creek).”</p>

<p>“Örnen” sailed from New Sweden in July, carrying home some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
the older colonists, with Lieutenant Papegåja, who was deputed to give
further information about the condition of the settlement. It was impossible
to provide the vessel with a sufficient cargo, but Rising shipped some
tobacco, which he had purchased in Virginia, to be sold on his private
account in Sweden.</p>

</div>

<p>We now know that news of Printz’s departure from the Delaware was
received soon after “Örnen” had left Gottenburg for America; and on
the 28th of February, 1654, Queen Christina commissioned Rising as
temporary Governor of New Sweden. By the same royal letter Hans
Amundson was removed from the supervision of “the defence of the
land and the forts,” and this duty was
intrusted to Sven Schute, in unwitting
anticipation of a request in Rising’s report
of the following July. In consequence
of incapacity exhibited on the voyage of “Gyllene Hajen” from
Stockholm to Gottenburg, he was likewise replaced in the command of
his vessel on the 4th of March, by Sven Höök, subject to the superior
orders of Henrich
von Elswich, of
Lübeck, who was
deputed to succeed
Huygen as
commissary in
the colony, taking care of the cargoes and funds, and keeping the books
of the Company.</p>

         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>In the hope of further developing the growth of the
settlement, on the 16th of the same month Queen Christina granted a
“<i>privilegium</i> for those who buy land or traffic in New Sweden or the West
Indies,” in accordance with which, whoever purchased ground of the Company
or of the Indians, with recognition of the jurisdiction of her Majesty
was assured allodial enfranchisement for himself and his heirs forever; while
subjects who exported goods which had already paid duty in the kingdom
or dependencies of Sweden, should be free from all imposts on the Delaware,
and were required to pay only two per cent (and nothing in Sweden)
on what they exported from that river. On the 15th of April “Gyllene
Hajen” was at last able to leave Gottenburg, with a number of emigrants
and a quantity of merchandise, and arrived at Porto Rico on the 30th of
June. Commissary Elswich was kindly received by the Spanish governor
of the island, Don Diego Aquilera, and on presenting letters from his Catholic
Majesty and Antonio de Pimentelli, the Spanish ambassador to Sweden,
with his claim for damages for “Kattan,” he was offered 14,030 Spanish dollars
as compensation from the Governor, but not deeming that sum sufficient
declined to accept it, in view of the good-will of the Spaniards and the prospect
of more satisfactory negotiations on the subject in the future. Amundson,
who had been permitted to accompany the expedition with his family,
to press his personal demands at Porto Rico, and settle as a private individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
upon the Delaware, died on the 2d of July, and was buried on the island. The
ship continued her voyage in August, and arrived off the continent September
12, when, either through the rashness or the malice of the mate, she was
conducted into a bay, believed to be the Delaware, which was in fact the
present New York harbor,&mdash;an error not discovered till she had reached
Manhattan. So favorable an opportunity to retaliate the seizure of Fort
Casimir by the Swedish governor was not suffered to pass unimproved by
the energetic Stuyvesant, who detained the vessel and cargo, and on the
refusal of Rising to visit New Amsterdam, or restore or pay for the Dutch
fort, the Dutch governor confiscated the goods, and equipped “Gyllene
Hajen,” under the name of “Diemen,” for the Curaçoa trade, in the service
of his West India Company. Most of the emigrants remained in New Netherland;
and Commissary Elswich, who vainly protested against such hostile
actions, did not arrive at the Delaware until the close of November.</p>

<p>On the occasion of the English Minister Whitelocke’s embassy to
Sweden, in May, 1654, a convention was adopted for the observance of
friendship between New Sweden and the English colonies in America, and
for the adjustment of their boundaries. Probably in ignorance of this,
during the ensuing summer the colonists of New Haven renewed their
project of forming a settlement on the Delaware. By order of the General
Court of July 5, Governor Theophilus Eaton addressed a letter on the
subject to Governor Rising, to which the latter replied August 1, affirming
the right of his sovereign to “all the lands on both sides Delaware Bay and
River,” and referring to “a conference or treaty before Mr. Endicott, wherein
New Haven’s right was silenced or suppressed.” This was deemed unsatisfactory
by the Commissioners of the United Colonies, to whom the letters
were submitted by Governor Eaton on the 23d of September, and the same
day another letter was written by these gentlemen to the Governor of New
Sweden, reciting their purchases of land from the Indians, and desiring explanations.
These communications being read at a General Court at New
Haven on the 2d of November, a committee was appointed to receive applications
from persons willing to emigrate, a company of whom appealed to
the Court for aid in their enterprise on the 30th of the following January.
This was readily accorded, and one of the number visited the Delaware to
ascertain the sentiment of the people residing there; but returning in
March, announced “little encouragement in the Bay,” while “a report of
three ships being come to the Swedes seemed to make the business more
difficult.” Although the undertaking was favored by the town of New
Haven both then and during April, no attempt appears to have been made
to carry it on.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1654 occurred the abdication of Queen Christina
and the death of her aged Chancellor, Axel Oxenstjerna; but these events
entailed no diminution of interest on the part of Sweden in the welfare of
her colony in America. Observing that the partners in the West India
Company “had not entered into their work with proper zeal,” on the 23d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
of December King Charles X. (Gustavus) instructed the College of Commerce
“to admonish them to do their duty, under penalty of forfeiting their
share of future profits,” and for their encouragement renewed the privilege
of the monopoly of the tobacco trade in Sweden and her dependencies,
which had been withdrawn Oct. 25, 1649.</p>

</div>

<p>In April, 1655, members of the
Company, including Johan Oxenstjerna, son of the late chancellor, and
Jöran Fleming, son of the late
admiral, were summoned before
the College of Commerce, now
presided over by Olof Andersson
Strömsköld, who at the same
time became Director of the
Company, to decide “whether they would contribute the capital needed
to carry on the enterprise, or relinquish their pretensions.” The associates
not relishing the latter alternative, the resolution was taken to disburse
the last of their funds, and to try to induce other persons to join
them in their work.</p>

<div class="floatright">

</div>

<p>It was even proposed to form a new company,
enjoying proprietorship of the land subject to the Crown of Sweden,
with increased privileges and immunities,&mdash;the scheme for this (dated
in May) being still preserved in the Archives of the kingdom, although
it does not seem to have been adopted, since it lacks the royal signature,
and is not comprised in the registry. On the 30th of July Johan Rising
was commissioned by the College of Commerce “Commandant” in New
Sweden,&mdash;the budget for 1655 also embracing a captain, a lieutenant, an
ensign, a sergeant, two gunners, a corporal, a drummer, and thirty-six soldiers,
a provost, and an executioner, with three clergymen, a commissary,
an assistant-commissary, a fiscal, a barber-surgeon, and an engineer, at an
annual expense of 4,404 riksdaler for the colony. In addition, certain employés
were occupied in Stockholm, at a charge of 834 riksdaler. The
Company likewise succeeded in fitting out the tenth and last Swedish expedition
to the Delaware, under the command of the former Commissary,
Hendrick Huygen, including Johan Papegåja, a Lutheran minister called
Herr Matthias, six Finnish families from Värmland, and other emigrants,
numbering in all eighty-eight souls, a hundred more being turned away for
want of room. The vessel selected on this occasion was the “Mercurius,”
which was ready to receive her cargo, consisting chiefly of linen and woollen
stuffs and salt, in July, but was obliged to wait for cannon and ammunition,
and did not sail from Gottenburg until the 16th of October. She bore a
letter to Rising promising that another ship should very soon follow.</p>

<p>The efforts of the last two years to strengthen the Swedish dominion on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
the Delaware were certainly sufficiently earnest to merit success; but they
were made too late. Their inadequacy to the present extremity rather
hastened the bursting of the storm which engulfed the political destiny of
the settlement. The Dutch West India Company had never entirely abandoned
their claim to jurisdiction over the shores of the “South River,” and
in April, 1654, apparently apprehending danger from the expedition under
Rising, determined to occupy Fort Casimir with a force of two hundred
men, who had been enlisted for service in New Netherland against the English,&mdash;a
duty for which they were not needed, in consequence of the recent
conclusion of peace. The surrender of this fort by Bikker was severely censured
by the Directors, who addressed letters to Stuyvesant, in November,
authorizing and urging the immediate undertaking of an expedition projected
by him, “to avenge this misfortune, not only by restoring matters
to their former condition, but also by driving the Swedes at the same time
from the river.” Documents were likewise called for, to be sent to Holland,
confirmatory of the claim of the Dutch company to the territory on the
Delaware, in anticipation, doubtless, of diplomatic controversies likely to
arise between the governments of Sweden and the States-General. Before
the receipt of these communications, however, Stuyvesant had gone on a
voyage to the West Indies, whence he did not return to New Amsterdam
until the middle of the following summer. Meanwhile the Dutch Directors
wrote to him approving of his seizure of “Gyllene Hajen,” and informing
him that they had chartered “one of the largest and best ships” of Amsterdam,
carrying thirty-six guns and two hundred men, to unite in the
enterprise against New Sweden, which was to be undertaken by the authorities
of New Netherland immediately on her arrival, in view of the “great
preparations making in Sweden to assist their countrymen on the South
River.” At the same time the orders of November were modified, so that
the Swedes might be permitted to retain the ground on which Fort Christina
was built, “with a certain amount of garden-land for the cultivation
of tobacco,” provided they considered themselves subjects of the Dutch
“State and Company.”</p>

<p>The ship referred to, called “De Waag” (the Balance), reached New
Amsterdam on the 4th of August, 1655, and Director-General Stuyvesant
at once completed his preparations for the invasion of New Sweden. A
small army of six or seven hundred men<a name="FNanchor_933_933" id="FNanchor_933_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a> was at length assembled, and
distributed upon “De Waag,” commanded by the Director-General in person,
and six other vessels, comprising a galiot, flyboat, and two yachts, each
mounting four guns. The whole force sailed on the 26th of August, arriving
off Delaware Bay the following afternoon, and casting anchor the day
after before the old Fort Elfsborg. On the night of the 30th their presence
was made known to the Swedes by a vigorous discharge of cannon,
and by the capture of some colonists by a party who had landed at Sandhoeck.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
The next morning the Dutch appeared in front of Fort Trinity.
In consequence of intimations received from the Indians, and confirmed
by the testimony of two spies who had been sent by Rising to Manhattan,
the advent of the Hollanders was not unexpected, and the garrison
had been increased to forty-seven men, while orders had been issued by
the Governor to Captain Schute, who still commanded at that post, to
fire upon the Dutch in case they should attempt to pass. This fact was
communicated by that officer to persons sent by Stuyvesant to demand
the surrender of the fort; and in a personal interview with the Director-General,
Schute solicited the privilege of transmitting an open letter to
Rising asking for further instructions. This was peremptorily denied him,
although a delay was afterward granted till the next morning, for a response
to the summons. Nevertheless during the night Schute contrived to get
word to Christina about his perilous situation, and nine or ten men were
despatched to his relief. These were intercepted, however, by the Hollanders,
two only escaping capture by retreating to their boat and returning
to their fort. At the same time a mutiny occurred among the garrison
of Fort Trinity, and fifteen or sixteen men were disarmed and put under
arrest. Two others deserted and reported the condition of affairs to
Stuyvesant. Resistance now seeming worse than useless, Schute met the
Director-General on “De Waag,” on the 1st of September, and consented
to capitulate, on promise of security for the persons and private property
of the officers, and the restoration to Sweden of the four iron guns and five
field-pieces constituting the armament of the redoubt. The captain accordingly
marched forth, with a guard of twelve men and colors flying, and the
place was occupied by the Dutch. In consequence of the omission to
stipulate a point of retreat for the garrison, on the 7th most of these were
sent by Stuyvesant, on his flyboat, to New Amsterdam. The day of the
surrender of Fort Trinity Factor Elswich presented himself before the
Director-General, on the part of Governor Rising, “to demand an explanation
of his conduct, and dissuade him from further hostilities,” but was
compelled to return without receiving satisfaction. Measures were therefore
immediately taken for the defence of Fort Christina, all the people
available being assembled at that place, where they “labored by night and
by day, strengthening the ramparts and filling gabions.” On the 2d of
September the Dutch appeared in force on the opposite bank of Christina
Creek, and on the 3d seized a Swedish shallop, and threatened to occupy
a neighboring house. Lieutenant Sven Höök was sent by Rising to inquire
their purpose, but he was detained by Stuyvesant on “De Waag.” By the
4th the Hollanders had planted gabions about the house referred to, and
under cover of these threw up a battery; and on the 5th landed on the
north side of Christina Creek, and erected batteries on Timber Island, at
Christinahamn, and on the west side of the fort. They completed their
investment of the place by anchoring their ships at the mouth of the
Fiske Kil, on the southeast. Some volleys of shot, fired over-head from
either side, assured Rising that he was entirely surrounded; and on the
6th a letter was brought by an Indian from Stuyvesant, “arrogantly
claiming the whole river,” and requiring all the Swedes to evacuate the
country, except such as were willing to remain under the protection of
the Dutch. A council of war was immediately held, at which it was
determined not to begin hostilities, but to act on the defensive, and, if
possible, to repel assaults.</p>

<p>The next morning Factor Elswich, Sergeant
Van Dyck, and Peter Rambo were sent to reply to Stuyvesant, with an
assertion of the
right of Sweden
to the Delaware,
exhorting him
to refrain from
acts which might
lead to a breach
between their
sovereign and
the States-General,
and protesting
his responsibility
for
all shedding of
blood at Fort
Christina. The
Dutchman did
not yield to their
arguments, and
on the 9th despatched
a letter
to Rising of similar
import to
that of the 6th,
which was answered with a proposal that their boundaries be settled by
their sovereigns, or by commissioners authoritatively appointed for that
purpose. No regard was paid to this, however, by Stuyvesant, and the
peculiar <i>quasi</i> siege was still continued, although no attempt was made to
harm the garrison, notwithstanding, says Rising, there was not a spot upon
the walls where they could have stood with safety. Meanwhile the Swedish
force, which numbered only about thirty men, some of whom were sick
and others ill-affected, noting the progress of the works of the enemy, and
anticipating the speedy exhaustion of their supplies, began to entertain
thoughts of surrender.</p>

Blaeu’s <i>Theatre

and bearing this
legend: “This

Lindström’s
manuscript map
of 1654, twenty-seven
inches
long, in the
Swedish Royal Archives, of which Armstrong
saw a copy in the library of the American Philosophical
Society (and another copy of which,
made for the late Joseph J. Mickley, has been
engraved in Reynolds’s translation of Acrelius).
The map of Visscher, without date (? 1654),

the others are copies more or less closely. Armstrong
did not, however, quite thoroughly scan
the field. De Laet’s map of 1633 appeared earlier

showing the bay in Speed’s <i>Prospect of the most
famous Parts of the World</i>, London, 1676, which
very blindly follow the Dutch maps; and we do
not get any better work till we come to Gabriel

<p>On the 13th Rising and Elswich had an interview
with Stuyvesant, and made a last appeal on behalf of the jurisdiction of their
sovereign over the territory of New Sweden, but were answered as before
by the Director-General. The Dutch now brought the guns of all their
batteries to bear upon the fort, and the following day formally summoned
the Swedish governor to capitulate within twenty-four hours,&mdash;a proposal
to which the garrison unanimously acceded, and articles of surrender were
drawn up on the 15th. In accordance with these, all artillery, ammunition,
provisions, and other effects belonging to the Crown of Sweden and the
South Company were to be retained by them; while officers, soldiers, ministers,
and freemen were permitted to keep their personal goods and have
liberty to go wherever they pleased, or remain upon the Delaware, protected
in the exercise of their Swedish Lutheran religion. Such of the
colonists as desired to return to their native country should be conveyed
thither on suitable vessels, free of expense; while Rising and Elswich, by
secret agreement, were to be landed in France or England. After accepting
these conditions, the Governor of New Sweden was approached by the
Director-General with a proposition singularly differing from that authorized,
as stated, by the Directors of the Dutch West India Company; namely,
that the Swedes should reoccupy their fort and maintain possession of the
land higher up the river, while the Hollanders merely reserved for themselves
that south of Christina Creek,&mdash;the two nations at the same time
entering into an offensive and defensive alliance with one another. It is
not easy to account for this action on the part of the victorious Dutchman,
unless we attribute it to the news of the invasion of New Amsterdam by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
large body of Indians, just learned through a letter from his Council, urging
his speedy return home, and the fear lest the Swedes might take advantage
of the predicament to retake all their territory. The unexpected offer
was reduced to writing at the desire of Rising, and was made the subject of
a consultation with his people, who rejected it, however, fearing duplicity
on the part of Stuyvesant, and dreading to incur the animosity entertained
by the English and the Indians towards the Hollanders. They also
thought they might thereby compromise the claim of their sovereign to
the whole territory of New Sweden, and preferred to leave it to their
“most worthy superiors,” as the Governor expressed it, “to resent and
redress their wrongs in their own time, and in such way and with such
force as might be requisite.” The delivery of this answer to the Director-General
terminated negotiations. As had been stipulated, Rising, Elswich,
Lindström, and other officers were allowed to remain in Fort Christina,
while the common soldiers were quartered on Timber Island, until the
time allotted for their departure for Manhattan. Those of the colonists
who determined to stay on the Delaware were required to take oaths
of allegiance to the States-General and the Dutch West India Company,
and to the Director-General and Council of New Netherland. An article
of the capitulation provided for the trial of Captain Schute for his
surrender of Fort Trinity. This took place presently, at a courtmartial
held by Governor Rising on Timber Island. The Swedish officer
denied the charges preferred against him; and there is no evidence that
he ever suffered punishment for them. During Stuyvesant’s sojourn in
New Sweden, and particularly while he was besieging Fort Christina,
the Dutch soldiers committed ravages upon the settlers, not only in this
vicinity and around Fort Trinity, but at New Gottenburg, Printzdorp, Upland,
Finland, and other points along the river, which were estimated by
Rising at over 5,000 florins, involving incidental losses very much greater.
On the 1st of October the Governor of New Sweden and his companions,
among whom were Engineer Lindström and Factor Elswich, with the
clergymen Nertunius and Hjort, embarked on “De Waag,” and “bade
farewell” to the Delaware. After arriving at New Amsterdam, they sailed
on three merchantmen in the beginning of November. Among the incidents
of their voyage was the unfortunate loss of Lindström’s chest of
instruments, maps, and professional papers, which fell overboard through
the carelessness of the sailors, and sank to the bottom of the sea. Rising
landed at Plymouth, England, from whence he went to London, on the 22d
of December, reporting the conquest of New Sweden to Johan Leyonberg,
the Swedish ambassador, while Lindström and his associates continued their
course to Holland. After suffering many hardships, both parties finally
reached their own country, and on the 17th of April certain of them
appeared before the College of Commerce, to render their accounts and
make their claims for services. On inquiry into the manner of the overthrow
of the colony, it was determined to present a detailed report of it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
his Majesty, and the returned emigrants were instructed to appeal for the
settlement of their demands to the Directors of the American Company.
The funds of the latter were estimated, April 27, 1655, at 158,178 riksdaler,
the chief items accredited, however, being “stock for building ships,” “the
cargo of ‘Örnen,’” “damages for ‘Kattan,’” “the territory of New Sweden
and its forts,”&mdash;securities which did not justify such a hopeful valuation.
At the present period their indebtedness was stated at 19,311 riksdaler,
their assets being augmented by claims against the Dutch West India
Company for the seizure of “Gyllene Hajen,” and afterward by the receipts
from the “Mercurius.” Their property was found to be insufficient
to discharge their many obligations, and for several years demands continued
to be presented on behalf of Printz, Rising, Anckerhelm, and others,
which there is little reason to think were ever fully satisfied.</p>

<p>During the occurrence of these events the “Mercurius” was wending
her way across the Atlantic, bearing the last hope of safety for the colony,
whose subjugation by the Dutch was not learned by her passengers until
their arrival in the Delaware, March 14, 1656. They were denied permission
to land until commands were received from Director-General Stuyvesant,
either to return at once to Sweden, or, in case they needed to lay in
provisions and other commodities for a fresh voyage, to repair with their
vessel to New Amsterdam. So unexpected a termination of their long and
arduous journey was naturally most distasteful to the emigrants, and Commissary
Huygen endeavored to change the purpose of the Dutch authorities
by paying them a visit and addressing to them a petition on the subject.
This was without avail, however, and he was obliged to order his ship, with
people and cargo, to Manhattan. The command was disobeyed by the
captain, who was compelled by Papegåja and other Swedes, who boarded
the vessel, to put passengers and goods ashore on the Delaware, deterring
the Hollanders from firing at them from Fort Casimir by carrying along
some friendly Indians, whom the Dutch were afraid to hurt. On the 3d
of May, therefore, two councillors were deputed to proceed to the South
River on “De Waag,” accompanied by Huygen, to enforce the command
of the latter; and in July the “Mercurius” was finally brought to New
Amsterdam by the Commissary, who obtained leave to sell her cargo
there by payment of a satisfactory duty. How many emigrants of this
last Swedish expedition to the Delaware remained in New Sweden is not
known.<a name="FNanchor_934_934" id="FNanchor_934_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a> The vessel bore back Herr Matthias, and probably Papegåja,
and arrived at Gottenburg in September of the same year.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it remains for us to indicate, very briefly, the measures
taken by the Government of Sweden to regain possession of their colony,
or, at least, to obtain compensation for the loss of it. As early as March,
1656, the Swedish Minister (Harald Appelboom) presented a memorial to
the States-General, demanding the re-establishment of the old situation
on the Delaware or the payment of indemnity to the American Company;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
and on the 3d of the following June Governor Rising submitted to his sovereign
a plan for the reconquest of that river, supported by an array of
arguments maintaining the right of Sweden to her settlement.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400">MAP OF THE ATLANTIC COLONIES.</p>
         <p class="pf400">This is the curious map given in Campanius,
p. 52. It was probably suggested by,
although it does not follow, a detailed and interesting
manuscript map of the Atlantic coast
from Cape Henry to Cape Ann, by Peter Lindstrom,
19¼ x 6⅞ inches in size, including “Virginia,”
“Nova Suecia,” “Nova Batavia,” and
“Nova Anglia,” which will soon be printed by
the Historical Society of Pennsylvania. [The
New England region has some reminiscences
of John Smith’s map of 1614, though that first
explorer did not place Mount Massachusetts
(Chevyot Hills,&mdash;that is, the modern Blue Hills
of Milton) on the borders of Lake Champlain;
but he did give the entities of London and Bristow
to non-existing towns. The early Dutch
maps are responsible for the curiously-shaped
shoal off Cape Cod, and for the southern line
of New England running west from Pye Bay
(Nahant). There was, of course, a necessity of
bringing “Massa Chuser” in some way above
that line.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>
</div></div>

<p>About this time, however, the King’s attention was absorbed by enterprises in Poland,
and soon after by the first war with Denmark, and nothing was accomplished;
but at a meeting of his Council, April 15, 1658, his Majesty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
“decided, <i>en passant</i>, that New Sweden was well worth endeavoring to
recover;” and in a decree concerning the tobacco trade, of the 22d of
May, the monopoly of the West India Company was further defined,
“chiefly, that the important colony of New Sweden might be preserved
now and hereafter to the great advantage” of the kingdom, “and that
the settlements of subjects in that region be not entirely abandoned.”
Still nothing was attempted on behalf of the colony, doubtless in consequence
of the breaking out of the second war with Denmark. The Company
was dissolved and the tobacco trade enfranchised in 1662. The
next year a fruitless demand upon the States-General for damages was
made by the Swedish Regency,<a name="FNanchor_935_935" id="FNanchor_935_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a> which was followed, on the rise of difficulties
between England and Holland in 1664, by the issue of orders to
Appelboom to give heed to the negotiations of these powers, and to protest
against the formal relinquishing of New Sweden to either nation before
the indemnification of his own. During the latter year attention was
still further attracted to the colony by the arrival in the spring at Amsterdam,
on a Dutch ship from Christiania, of a hundred and forty Finns
from the region of Sundsvall, who had been encouraged to emigrate by
letters from relatives and friends who were living on the Delaware. The
Swedish Government, not knowing of this correspondence, and supposing
the Finns had been enticed by secret emissaries from Holland, instructed
Resident Peter Trotzig and Appelboom to remonstrate against the enterprise,
and to demand that the people should be returned “at the cost of
those who had deceived them.” Nevertheless, the emigrants sailed in June
for New Sweden in a vessel furnished by the city of Amsterdam; and the
Swedish authorities were obliged to content themselves with requiring
strict surveillance on the part of the governors of certain provinces in
Finland to prevent such actions in the future. The matter was not referred
to in the memorials addressed by Appelboom to the States-General
the same month, although these boldly claimed restitution of the territory
of New Sweden to the Swedish West India Company, with reimbursement
of all damages sustained by it,&mdash;in support of which demands
the Government also solicited the countenance and aid of France and
England. This topic was renewed on occasion of the embassy of Isbrandt
to Sweden; and at a conference held Nov. 16, 1665, after some attempts
to defend the conduct of his countrymen on the Delaware, the Dutch
envoy actually proposed that Swedes and Hollanders should endeavor,
“<i>junctis viribus</i>,” to retake the territory from the English, who then controlled
it. Isbrandt afterward requested proofs of the Swedish claims, for
presentation to his Government. On Dec. 24, 1666, the College of Commerce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
was commanded to furnish these evidences to Count Christoffer
Delphicus von Dohna and Appelboom, who were appointed to treat with
the States-General upon the subject. A paper was drawn up, therefore, by
that body, Feb. 27, 1667, comprising the usual arguments and copies of documents,
with specifications of the losses of the Swedish West India Company,
including interest amounting to the sum of 262,240 riksdaler. On the
other hand, the Dutch negotiators, among whom were Isbrandt and John de
Witt, produced counter claims and complaints of the Dutch Company, and
demanded that “the pretensions on both sides be reciprocally dismissed.”
At the final convention at the Hague, July 18, it was “ordered and decreed”
that these controversies “be examined as soon as possible by his Majesty’s
envoy, according to the principles of justice and equity, and satisfaction
then, immediately and without delay, be given to the injured party.” It
could hardly be expected, however, that the Hollanders would pay claims
on property no longer theirs, especially when the loss of New Netherland
had well nigh ruined the Dutch West India Company, which ought, ordinarily,
to have met the obligations thus incurred. That nothing was done is
evident from the fact that the Swedish Government soon afterward exerted
itself, with unrepining zeal, to obtain indemnity from the power now exercising
dominion over their former territory. Before the terms of the Peace
of Breda were known, instructions had been issued to Dohna “to inquire
whether England or Holland was in possession of New Sweden, and treat
with the proper nation for the restoration of it to Sweden;” and April 28,
1669, Leyonberg, still Swedish minister at London, was required, “without
attracting attention, secretly, adroitly, and cautiously” to endeavor to discover
what England designed to do with her new acquisition. Subsequently
papers were drawn up, setting forth the grounds of the Swedish claim to
the territory in dispute, and the English ambassador at Stockholm promised
“to contribute his best offices with his sovereign” to procure its recognition.
From a response of Leyonberg to his Swedish Majesty, dated July 24, 1669,
we learn that the question had been mooted by him, but was always put
aside with assertions of the rights of England, in view of the neglect of
Sweden to demand her colony at the conclusion of peace. Concerning the
condition of the settlement, he had heard great praise of “the diligence and
industry, the alacrity and docility of the Swedes” then dwelling on the
Delaware, and had been told “their lands were the best cultivated in all
that region.” Since we do not meet with any evidence that the Swedish
claims were ever again referred to, we presume that at last the subject was
dropped, and that henceforth the American colony was universally regarded
as finally lost to Sweden.</p>

<p>Thus terminates the history of New Sweden under Swedish sovereignty.
Although for twenty-five years after the departure of the last governor the
people whose immigration to our continent has been related were almost
the only civilized residents on the shores of the Delaware, and were practically
nearly as independent as their fathers under the rules of Queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
Christina and King Charles X. (Gustavus), they were now nominally subjects
of their High Mightinesses the Lords States-General, and later of King
Charles II. of England, and their career is properly included in accounts
of the Dutch and English dominions of that epoch. Henceforth their connection
with the mother country was confined to the limited ecclesiastical
sphere of the Swedish Lutheran religion; and this was only ultimately
brought to a close at the death of the Reverend Nicholas Collin, the last
Swedish pastor of Gloria Dei Church in Philadelphia, in 1831, a hundred
and seventy-six years after the conquest of New Sweden by Governor
Stuyvesant. During all this period of perpetual contact with an enormously
increasing population of other races, certain of the descendants of
the Swedes who first cultivated this region sedulously observed ancestral
customs, and preserved the knowledge and use of their maternal tongue
within family circles. And if, on the other hand, intermarriage with their
neighbors eventually confounded many of the old stock with English and
German colonists of later immigrations, this merely extended the influence
of that virtuous and industrious people, who became the progenitors of not
a few citizens of note of several of our chief provinces and commonwealths.
The colonization scheme we have endeavored to portray failed, without
doubt, of the significance anticipated for it in the enlargement of the empire
and the development of the trade and commerce of Sweden; but it formed
the nucleus of the civilization which afterward acquired such expansion
under William Penn and his contemporaries through the founding of
Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New Jersey, and was the first impulse of that
modern movement,&mdash;in strong contrast with the wild spirit of the ancient
Scandinavian sea-kings and pre-Columbian discoverers of America,&mdash;which
has contributed so large and useful a population to Illinois and Wisconsin
and other Western States of our Republic.</p>

from <i>De Hollandsche Mercurius</i>. This, with sundry maps elsewhere referred to, constitutes,
it is believed, all the contemporaneous printed matter which is still preserved

<p>A short account of the colony is contained in Samuel Puffendorf’s <i>Commentarii de
Rebus Suecicis</i>, published at Utrecht in 1686. It was not, however, until 1702 that a book
appeared professedly treating of the settlement. This was the <i>Kort Beskrifning om Provincien

a collection as the author was able to make it of the printed materials for the history and
description of New Netherland.” It mentions several works connected with the history
of New Sweden, particularly those of Willem Usselinx, whose character and aims in

appreciated by the writer;<a name="FNanchor_998_998" id="FNanchor_998_998"></a><a href="#Footnote_998_998" class="fnanchor">[998]</a> and its account of maps embracing the Delaware admirably

article on “The Swedes on the Delaware and their Intercourse with New England,”
by Frederic Kidder, giving a résumé of the statements of earlier authors, and including
an English translation of a Dutch copy of an “Examination upon the letters of the Governor
of New England to the Governor of New Sweden,” in the presence of Governor
Printz and others, Jan. 16, 1644, and letters of Governors Printz and Winthrop<a name="FNanchor_1002_1002" id="FNanchor_1002_1002"></a><a href="#Footnote_1002_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a> never

but it records the discovery in the autumn of 1873, in a grave near Washington, Lancaster
County, in that State, of certain so-called “Indian relics,” one of which, now in the possession
of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania (represented in a cut in the book), so
nearly resembles the helmet of the Swedish soldier of the seventeenth century (shown in
a figure at the late Centennial Exhibition of Philadelphia), as to suggest the possibility
that it may have been worn by a soldier of New Sweden. The book reproduces Campanius’s
map of New Sweden after Nicolas Visscher.</p>

of Lund, which gives the most complete account of the founding and early history
of the colony of New Sweden yet written, based on the Oxenstjerna manuscripts and
numerous other documents preserved in several departments of the archives of Sweden.
At the end of this invaluable contribution to our knowledge of the settlement is given
nearly the whole of Printz’s <i>Relation</i> to the Swedish West India Company of 1644, with
its accompanying <i>Rulla</i> of all the people then living on the Delaware.</p>

“Documents relating to the History of the Dutch and Swedish Settlements on the

Nya Sveriges Grundläggning</i>, already spoken of. After briefly capitulating the statements
of the latter treatise with regard to the origin of the enterprise, and the history
of the first four Swedish expeditions to the Delaware, and the one from Holland under
Swedish auspices, the author proceeds to give the only account yet written of the equipment
of the last six expeditions from Sweden, with fresh details as to their fate, drawn
chiefly from unpublished manuscripts in the archives of his country. He also supplies
the Swedish version of the difficulties with the Dutch and English, and recites the several
endeavors of Sweden either to recover possession of her colony or to obtain satisfactory
compensation for her loss of it. In the Appendix are printed documents relating to purchases
of land from the Indians, and the Report of Governor Rising, dated July 13, 1654.
A map of New Sweden, which accompanies the dissertation, indicates the principal places
and the boundaries of the settlement.</p>

series of articles, by the writer of this essay, on “The Descendants of Jöran Kyn, the
Founder of Upland,”&mdash;the only genealogical account of the posterity of an early Swedish
settler on the Delaware yet printed. Besides speaking of persons who bore the family
name, it includes sketches of, or references to, Captain Sven Schute, Lieutenant Anders
Dahlbo, the Rev. Lars Carlson Lock, Doctor Timon Stiddem, and Justices Peter Rambo,
Peter Cock, and Olof Stille, inhabitants of New Sweden whose offspring intermarried
with members of the Kyn (or Keen) family, and supplies instances of matrimonial alliances
between the latter and many distinguished Americans of English, Scotch, Irish,
French, Dutch, and German ancestry, as well as noblemen and gentlemen of Europe.</p>

maps of Tinicum, Upland, Marcus Hook, and their vicinities, indicating tracts of land
originally held by Swedes, as publicly recorded. It also includes an excellent essay on
land titles in the county, with translations of Swedish grants to Governor Printz and
other settlers.</p>

<p class="p2">The above list of printed authorities on the history of New Sweden is designed to
comprise all books within the knowledge of the writer which present either new facts or
noteworthy opinions in relation to that subject. It only remains for him to add that all
the unpublished manuscripts concerning the topic still extant are in Sweden, the greater
part among the archives of the Kingdom at Stockholm, some among those of Skokloster,
and others in the Palmskiöld Collections of the Library of the University of Upsala, and
in the Library of the University of Lund. These embrace papers of Usselinx, correspondence
of Oxenstjerna with Spiring, Blommaert, and Minuit, documents with regard
to the Swedish West India Company and the equipment of the several expeditions to the
Delaware, commissions and instructions for officers of the colony, letters and reports of
the governors, and other records of the settlement, and diplomatic intercourse between
Sweden and foreign nations about colonial questions of mutual interest.<a name="FNanchor_1014_1014" id="FNanchor_1014_1014"></a><a href="#Footnote_1014_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a> Copies of many
of these (including nearly the whole of Lindström’s writings) have been procured by the
late Mr. Mickley and other worthy antiquaries for the Historical Society of Pennsylvania,
and are in process of translation for publication under the auspices of that body.
From those manuscripts was extracted much of the material of a discourse on “The
Early Swedish Colony on the Delaware,” read by the writer of this essay at the annual
meeting of the same Society in May, 1881,<a name="FNanchor_1015_1015" id="FNanchor_1015_1015"></a><a href="#Footnote_1015_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a> and before the Historical Society of Delaware
the following November; and from them has also been derived whatever appears in print
for the first time in the preceding narrative.<a name="FNanchor_1016_1016" id="FNanchor_1016_1016"></a><a href="#Footnote_1016_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a></p>

Egypt may perhaps afford an exception; but it is probable that the germs of its civilization
came from Asia. All its relations are essentially Asiatic.</p>

It is likely that some part of the Aryan folk
found their way to the Pacific shore in Corea
and elsewhere; but the Aryan migrations setting
to the East must have been uncommon, and
the chance of Caucasian blood reaching America
by this route small.</p>

I have elsewhere (Introduction to the
<i>Memorial History of Boston</i>) noticed the fact
that this difficulty in clearing the glaciated
soils led the early settlers of New England
to use the poorer soils first. Along the
shore and the rivers there is a strip of sandy
terrace deposits, the soils of which are rather
lean, but which are free from boulders, so
that the labor of clearing was relatively small.
All, or nearly all, the first settlements in the
glaciated districts were made on this class of
soils.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a></span>
The slow progress of our agricultural exports
during the first two hundred years of the
history of this country, is in good part to be
explained by the stubborn character of the
soil which was then in use. The only easily
subdued soils in use before 1800 were those of
Virginia and Maryland. The sudden advance
of the export trade in grain during the last
fifty years marks the change which brought
the great areas of non-glaciated soils of the
Mississippi Valley and the South under cultivation.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a></span>
It is an interesting fact that while America
has given but one domesticated animal to Europe,
in the turkey, it has furnished a number
of the most important vegetables, among them
maize, tobacco, and the potato. The absence of
strong domesticable animals in America doubtless
affected the development of civilization
among its indigenous people. The buffalo is
apparently not domesticable. The horse, which
seems to have been developed on North American
soil, and to have spread thence to Europe
and Asia, seems to have disappeared in America
before the coming of man to its shores. The
only beast which could profitably be subjugated
was the weak vicuna, which could only be used
for carrying light burdens. But for the help
given them by the sheep, the bull, and the horse,
we may well doubt if the Old-World races would
have won their way much more effectively than
those of America had done.</p>

The following statement concerning the history
of this brigade during the campaign of 1864
was given me by my friend, General Fayette
Hewett, who was adjutant of the command:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc4 p1">“On the 7th of May, 1864, the Kentucky Brigade
marched out of Dalton 1140 strong. The hospital
reports show, that, up to September 1, 1,850 wounds
were taken by the command. This includes the killed;
but many were struck several times in one engagement,
in which case the wounds were counted as one. In two
battles over 51 per cent of all engaged were killed or
wounded. During the whole campaign there were not
more than ten desertions. The campaign ended with
240 men able to do duty; less than 50 were without
wounds.”</p>

It is worth while to notice that this Dutch
colony never had the energetic life of the English
settlements, which may be in part attributed to
the effort to fix the Continental seigniorial relations
upon the land. It failed here as it failed in
Canada, but it kept both colonies without the
breath of hopeful, eager life which better land-laws
gave to the English settlements. Nothing shows
so well the perfect unfitness of all seigniorial land-systems
to the best development of a country as
the entire failure which met all efforts to fix it
in American colonies.</p>

<i>Paesi nouamente retrouati, et nouo Mondo da
Alberico Vesputio Florentino intitulato.</i> The volume
has often been catalogued under the name
of Vespucius (the only name that appears upon
its titlepage). It has been ascribed to Zorzi on
the authority of a note by Humboldt in his
<i>Examen critique</i>, iv. 79. Harrisse, in describing
the book (<i>Bibliotheca Americana vetustissima</i>,
no. 48, pp. 96<sup>d</sup>-99), accepted this statement; but
in the Appendix to the volume, at p. 469, he says
that M. d’Avezac has pointed out that Zorzi collected
only some additional manuscript matter
in a copy in the Magliabechian Library. Harrisse,
therefore, in the <i>Additions</i> to his <i>Bibliotheca</i>,
published in 1872, reinserts the title (no. 26, pp.
34-38), and credits the volume to Montalboddo.
There is a copy in Harvard College Library,
dated Nov. 17, 1508, which is supposed to be of the
second edition. The work was translated into
French, German, Dutch, and Latin. There is a

<i>Recherches sur les voyages et découvertes des
navigateurs Normands.</i> 8vo, Paris, 1832. M.
Estancelin gives (pp. 216-240) a translation of
the Italian version of the great captain’s discourse.
He thinks that it may have been
written by Pierre Mauclerc, the astronomer of
the “Sacre,” one of Parmentier’s vessels; but
MM. d’Avezac and Margry attribute it to Pierre
Crignon, who was also of Parmentier’s company.
See Introduction to the <i>Bref Récit</i> of
Jacques Cartier, p. vii; and Margry’s <i>Les Navigations
Françaises</i>, pp. 130, 199. The Journal of
the Sumatra voyage was found by M. Estancelin
among the papers of a M. Tarbé at Sens, who
inherited it from his brother, a merchant at
Rouen; see <i>Recherches</i>, pp. 191, 192. M. Harrisse
(<i>Jean et Sébastien Cabot</i>, pp. 301-303) describes
two other manuscripts relating to Parmentier’s
voyage, the more important of which
will be published in the series of Voyages of
which the Cabot is the first volume. Cf. Murphy,

Lescarbot, Charlevoix, and others speak of
it. The earliest French mention in print is said
to be that of Belleforest, in his <i>Histoire universelle
du monde</i>, 1570. It was repeated in his
1575 edition; and more at length in his <i>Cosmographie
universelle de tout le monde</i>. Ribault,
whose expedition took place in 1562, and Laudonnière
(1564-1565) both speak of it. But the
work of the latter was not printed until 1586,
and it has been supposed that the <i>editio princeps</i>
of Ribault is the English translation published
in 1563. Hakluyt’s statement, in his
<i>Discourse concerning Westerne Planting</i> (Maine
Historical Society, 2d ser., ii. 20), that Ribault’s
narrative was “extant in printe bothe in Frenche
and Englishe,” makes it quite possible, however,
that the mention in Belleforest is not the earliest
printed one. Cf. Shea’s <i>Charlevoix</i>, i. 107.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Among the English authors Hakluyt should
be particularly mentioned. He speaks in the
Dedication of his <i>Divers Voyages</i> (Hakluyt Society’s
ed., p. 11) of Verrazano having been
“thrise on that coast” [the American], and of
an “olde excellent mappe which he gaue to
king Henrie the eight;” giving also a representation
of Lok’s map, made “according to Verazanus
plat.” In his <i>Discourse on Westerne
Planting</i>, first published by the Maine Historical
Society in 1877, he says (pp. 113, 114): “There
is a mightie large olde mappe in parchemente,
made, as yt shoulde seme, by Verarsanus ...
nowe in the custodie of Mr. Michael Locke;”
and again, of “an olde excellent globe in the
Queenes privie gallory at Westminster, which
also semeth to be of Verarsanus makinge.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">Herrera condenses the account of the voyage
from the letter published by Ramusio; De Barcia
(<i>Ensayo chronologico para la historia general
de la Florida</i>, 1723) also gives it. This latter
identifies Verrazano with the corsair, Juan Florin.
Dr. Kohl gives an interesting account of Verrazano’s
voyage, with a valuable Appendix on
maps, in the eighth chapter of his <i>Discovery of
Maine</i>.</p>

Dr. Kohl (p. 326) says that Alezay was
an island near the present Prince Edward, and
that the latter was called Brion, having one
of its capes named “Orleans,” still found on
old maps. But Orleans is also found on the
mainland of New Brunswick. Prince Edward
Island appears on the Henri II., or the Dauphin’s
map (1546), as “Alezay.” The “Cabot”
map (1544) calls Prince Edward Island “y<sup>a</sup> de
S. Juan.” Allefonsce (1542), in maps and
Relations, calls it “Saint Jehan.” At this
point the student should consult Hakluyt,
iii. 205.</p>

In 1642 the Sieur Maissonneuve selected the

Modern Representatives: an Attempt to Illustrate
the Characters and Conditions of Prehistoric Men
in Europe by those of the American Race</i>. London,
Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 1880, chaps. ii. and iii.
By his excavations, Dr. Dawson has brought to
light relics of the Hochelagans, whose ethnic
relations he has studied, finding evidence which
convinces him that they were representatives of a
decaying nation to which the Eries and others
belonged, and that originally they were connected
with the Mound-Builders. He uses their
history in combating some views entertained respecting
the antiquity of the Stone Age.</p>

Professor Dawson, speaking of the account
in the narrative, which says “that the most precious
thing that they have in all the world they
call <i>esurguy</i>, which is white, and which they
take in the said river in cornifats,” explains
that <i>esurguy</i> is “probably a vulgar local name
for some shell supposed to resemble that of
which these Indians made their wampum. I
would suggest that it may be derived from <i>cornet</i>,
which is used by old French writers as a
name for the shells of the genus Voluta, and is
also a technical term in conchology. In this
case it is likely that the esurguy was made of
the shells of some species of Melania or Paludina,
just as the Indians on the coast used for
beads and ornaments the shells of <i>Purpura lapillus</i>
and of Dentalium, etc. It is just possible
that Cartier may have misunderstood the mode
of procuring these shells, and that the [his]
statement may refer to some practice of making
criminals and prisoners <i>dive</i> for them in the
deeper parts of the river.”&mdash;<i>Fossil Men</i>, etc.,

When Champlain was at Quebec he thought
that he identified the site of Cartier’s fort, where
he found hewn timber decayed and several cannon
balls near the St. Charles and the Lairet.

mention the remains. Faillon (<i>Histoire de la
Colonie Française</i>, i. 496) discusses the site of
Cartier’s wintering-place. Lemoine (<i>Picturesque
Quebec</i>, p. 484) speaks of the remains of one of
Cartier’s vessels being discovered in 1843, some
parts of which were carried to St. Malo.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

Possibly he had only three; see <i>Coleccion</i>,
etc., p. 107. That he had five is the statement
of Hakluyt. The Spaniards understood that
Cartier had thirteen ships, Smith’s <i>Coleccion</i>,
p. 107. Hakluyt is perhaps in error where he
asserts that it was agreed to build five ships.
Two of the ships actually sailing with this Expedition
were the “Great Hermina” and the
“Emerilon.”</p>

[In the Archives of St. Malo (1538) is a
record of the baptism of three savages brought
there by Cartier. <i>Massachusetts Archives, Documents
collected in France</i>, i. 367. Faillon (<i>Histoire
de la Colonie Française</i>, i. 524) believes that
the Indians found on the St. Lawrence were
Iroquois, who were succeeded in Champlain’s
time by Algonquins. Bonnetty in the <i>Annales
de philosophie Chrétienne</i>, September, 1869, has
discussed the question: “Quels étaient les sauvages
que rencontra Cartier sur les rives du Saint-Laurent.”
Captain J. Carleill, in his undated
tract (of about 1583) called <i>Discourse upon the
Entended Voyage to ... America</i> (<i>Carter-Brown
Catalogue</i>, vol. i. no. 350), refers to Cartier’s abduction
of the Indians as putting “the whole
countrey people into such dislike with the
Frenche, as neuer since they would admit any
conversation or familiaritie with them, until of
late yeares.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

It might indeed be supposed that Roberval,
instead of reaching Canada in the autumn
of 1541, wintered on the Atlantic coast, and
thus met Cartier at Newfoundland in 1542. Indeed,
Sir William Alexander says, in his <i>Encouragement
to Colonies</i> (p. 15), that Roberval
lived “one winter at Cape Breton;” but for
the statement he gives no authority, while his
style is loose, and by Cape Breton he probably
meant Canada, since Roberval would have sailed
direct from Cape Breton to the St. Lawrence,
instead of circumnavigating Newfoundland.</p>

In neither of these narratives do we find any
reference to those who preceded Cartier in the
New Land; nor even, except in two cases, is
there a passing allusion to contemporary voyages;
yet both Normans and Bretons were active.
Again, there is no mention of any map or
chart.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The Normans and Bretons probably sailed
to the banks of Newfoundland before Cabot
made <i>Prima Vista</i>. An early mention of their
voyages is that of the <i>Gran Capitano Francese</i>
of 1539, found in Ramusio (<i>Raccolta</i>, 1556,
iii. 359), where they are spoken of as frequenting
the northern parts thirty-five years
before, and giving a well-known headland its
present name of Cape Breton. [This “gran
capitano” is held by Estancelin in his <i>Navigateurs
Normands</i> to be Jean Parmentier of Dieppe,
and Pierre Crignon is named as the writer of
the somewhat confused <i>routier</i> and narrative
given in Ramusio. Cf. Shea’s <i>Charlevoix</i>, i.
132; Major’s <i>Early Voyages to Terra Australis</i>,
Introduction; and Murphy’s <i>Verrazzano</i>, p. 85.
Harrisse (<i>Cabots</i>, p. 249) also discusses the question
of the Capitano’s identity.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>] Ramusio
also (iii. 359) refers to Jean Denys and the pilot
Gamort, of Rouen, who sailed to Newfoundland
in a ship of Honfleur about the year 1506.
Ramusio (iii. 359) also mentions that Thomas
Aubert of Dieppe voyaged thither in the “Pensée”
in 1508.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Gosselin shows that in 1508 other ships
sailed to Newfoundland, and that they were
generally of a tonnage from sixty to ninety tons.
“I cite, among others,” he says, “‘Bonne-Aventure,’
Captain Jacques de Rufosse; the ‘Sibille’
and the ‘Michel,’ belonging to Jehan Blondel;
and then the ‘Marie de Bonnes Nouvelles,’
equipped by Guillaume Dagyncourt, Nicolas
Duport, and Loys Luce, associated citizens, the
command of the ship being given to Captain
Jean Dieulois” (<i>Documents</i>, etc., p. 13). In
view of those cases, which appear to be a few of
many, how poor is the appearance of that scepticism
which has so long led writers to look
askance at the statements of Ramusio concerning
Aubert and the “Pensée”! The records of
Normandy and Brittany are doubtless rich in
facts relating to obscure points of American
history.</p>
<p class="pfc4">[There is in Mr. Parkman’s Collection (vol, i.
p. 89), among the copies made for him in France
by Mr. Poore, a map of the St. Lawrence Gulf,
with the route of Cartier in 1534 pricked out.
The map is signed N. B.; and I suppose it to
have been made by Bellin, the map-maker who
supplied Charlevoix with his maps. Faillon
(<i>Histoire de la Colonie Francaise</i>, i. 523) argues
that all three of the <i>Relations</i> as we have them
were the work of Cartier himself. Ramé gives a
copy of an ancient register at St. Malo, said to
be in Cartier’s hand, which preserves the names
of his companions.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

“The division of authority between Cartier
and Roberval defeated the undertaking.
Roberval was ambitious of power, and Cartier
desired the exclusive honor of discovery. They
neither embarked in company nor acted in concert.
In May, 1541, Cartier sailed from St. Malo.
Arrived at the scene of his former adventures,
near the site of Quebec, he built a fort; but no
considerable advances in geographical knowledge
appear to have been made. The winter
passed in sullenness and gloom. In June, 1542,
he and his ships returned to France, just before
Roberval arrived with a considerable reinforcement.
Unsustained by Cartier, Roberval accomplished
no more than a verification of
previous discoveries. Remaining about a year
in America, he abandoned his immense vice-royalty.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">There is, however, no good proof of these
charges. At the time when Roberval is represented
as contending with Cartier, the former
must have been in Canada. We have no proof
of any conflict of authority. Facts recited in
the present chapter do not appear to have
been known to Mr. Bancroft. Kohl (<i>Discovery
of Maine</i>, p. 343) appears to have known nothing
beyond what is found in Hakluyt with reference
to the meeting at St. John’s. Parkman (<i>Pioneers
of France</i>, p. 202, edition of 1882) says that Roberval
sailed for Canada in April, 1542, and that,
soon after reaching St. John’s, “he descried three
other sail rounding the entrance to the haven,
and with wrath and amazement recognized the
ships of Cartier.... The Viceroy ordered him
to return; but Cartier escaped with his vessels
under cover of night, and made sail for France.”
See also Gay’s <i>Popular History of the United
States</i>, i. 188; and, on these voyages, <i>Biographie
des Malouins célèbres</i>, Paris, 1824; <i>St. Malo illustré

D’Avezac’s edition of the voyage of 1545, Paris,

known that Roberval sailed in 1541, instead of
1542. Hatton, in his <i>Newfoundland</i>, London,
1883, p. 14, also goes very wide of the mark.</p>

An episode in the voyage of Roberval, not
alluded to by Hakluyt, is preserved in Thevet’s
<i>Cosmographie universelle</i>, Paris, 1575. Thevet
drew his accounts of New France partly from
the navigators and partly from his imagination,
deliberately inventing facts where he deemed it
necessary, being upon the whole a mendacious
character. Nevertheless he was well acquainted
with Roberval and Cartier, and is said to have
lived six months with the latter at St. Malo.
[<i>The Northmen in Maine</i>, by Dr. De Costa,
p. 63, and <i>Biographie universelle</i>, 1826-1827, vol.
xxv.; also, vol. xlix. on Villegagnon.] This episode
covers the case of Roberval’s niece, who in
1541 went on the voyage with him, becoming the
victim of a young man who followed her from
France. As punishment, she was put ashore
with her old nurse on an island called the Isle
of Demons, which figures prominently in the
map found in the Ptolemy of Ruscelli, her lover
being allowed to join them. On this island
both of her companions died. After more than
two years she was rescued by a fishing-vessel,
and carried to France. Her story was first told
in the <i>Heptameron</i> of Marguerite, published
at Paris in 1559, forming number lxvii: “Extrême
amour et austérité de femme en terre étrange.”
Thevet, in his <i>Cosmographie</i> (ii. 1019), recasts
the story, and says that he had the account from
the princess herself, who, in a little village of
Périgord, met the young woman, who had sought
an asylum there from the wrath of her uncle Roberval.
In his <i>Grand insulaire</i>, a manuscript
preserved in the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris
(Harrisse, <i>Notes</i>, p. 278), which antedates his <i>Cosmographie</i>,
Thevet also has a version of the story.
In the latter work it is given in connection with
the fabulous account of a Nestorian bishop. It
is illustrated by a picture of the woman on the
Isle of Demons shooting wild beasts.</p>

[There have been various theories regarding
the origin of the name <i>Canada</i>, for which
see Faillon, <i>Histoire de la Colonie Française</i>, i.
14; Warburton’s <i>Conquest of Canada</i> (New York
edition), i. 54; <i>Historical Magazine</i>, i. 153, 188,

Naturalist</i>, 1861; <i>Magazine of American History</i>,
1883, p. 161; and Canniff’s <i>Upper Canada</i>,
p. 3. There seems to have been a belief in New
England, at a later day, that “Canada” was
derived from William and Emery de Caen
(Cane, as the English spelled it), who were in
New France in 1621, and later. Cf. Morton’s
<i>New English Canaan</i>, Adams’s edition, p. 235,
and Josselyn’s <i>Rarities</i>, p. 5; also, J. Reade in his

This began with Charlevoix, who (Shea’s
edition, i. 129) says: “The King, by letters-patent
inserted in the <i>Etat ordinaire des guerres</i>,
in the Chambre des Comptes at Paris, dated
Jan. 15, 1540, declares him Lord of Norimbequa,
Saguenay, Newfoundland, Belleisle, Carpon,
Labrador, Great Bay, and Baccalas, giving
him all these places with his own royal power
and authority.” This is questioned by Parkman
(<i>Pioneers of France</i>, p. 197); and in his
note to Charlevoix’s statement, Dr. Shea says
that Parkman “confounds his commission and
patent,” referring to Lescarbot’s edition of 1618,
which, however, does not bear out the statement,
recalled later. Allefonsce says (Hakluyt,
iii. 239), “The extension of all these lands upon
just occasion is called New France. For it is
as good and temperate as France, and in the
same latitude.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">[The appellation of <i>New France</i>, according to
Parkman (<i>Pioneers of New France</i>, p. 184), was
earliest applied, just succeeding the voyage of
Verrazano; and the Dutch geographers, he says,
are especially free in the use of it, out of spite
to the Spaniards. Faillon, in his <i>Histoire de la
Colonie Française</i>, i. 511, errs in tracing its earliest
use to Cartier’s second <i>Relation</i>, where, writing in
the third person, he says, “aux terres neuves, par
lui [nous?] appellées Nouvelle France.” Shea,
in his <i>Charlevoix</i>, ii. 20, finds the “Nova Gallia”
of the globe of Euphrosynus Ulpius (1542) as
early a use as any of those which he records.
Charlevoix himself had not traced it back of
Lescarbot (1609).&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

Harrisse, in his <i>Jean et Sébastien Cabot</i>
(Paris, 1882, p. 206), quotes from <i>La grande
insulaire</i> of Thevet a manuscript in the Bibliothèque
Nationale, showing that he was detained
a prisoner at Poitiers by Francis I.; while in his
<i>Cosmographie universelle</i>, folio 1021, he says it
was “pour la prinse de quelques naviere d’Espaigne.”
Allefonsce was a privateer, or “corsair,”
and was so zealous in his work, that, to
propitiate Spain, the King was obliged to put
him in prison. He probably gave too much
offence to the king’s enemies.</p>

It might appear that Allefonsce was dead
at the time; his <i>Cosmographie</i> was finished in

Secalart. The lines referred to are as follows:</p>

This work is preserved in the Manuscript
Department of the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris,
no. 676, under Secalart. It is a stout paper folio,
9 × 13 inches, written on both sides. This rude
specimen of penmanship was originally designed
for Francis I., like the book of John Rotz now
in the British Museum. It contains 194 leaves;
the titlepage is wanting. On what now forms
the second leaf of the third page is found the
following: “Jehan allafonsce&mdash;:&mdash;Paulin secalert,”
with the motto: “Pouvre et Loil.”</p>

<p class="pfc4">It is
signed “Nous Jehan allefonsce et Paulin Secalert.”
Underneath is the
date. “Paulin” might,
perhaps, be read “Raulin.”
The first line of
every page is in red, the
initials forming grotesque human faces. The
work abounds in flourishing capitals, and the
text is difficult to decipher. The maps are
rude sketches, intercalated to illustrate the
text, and washed with yellowish, reddish, and
greenish tints. The islands are chiefly in gold,
though some are red and green. At the end of
the volume is a map of France with the royal
arms. On a map of England is a rude representation
of London. There are also four pages
of plans and diagrams, relating chiefly to London
and Bordeaux. The legends on the maps are
written in a brown tint, much faded, though
upon the whole the volume is in a good state of
preservation. Cf. “L’hydrographie d’un découvreur
du Canada,” in Margry’s <i>Navigations

It will be remembered (Hakluyt, iii. 6) that
Cabot’s <i>Prima Vista</i> was near “the Island of St.
John.” On the map is the fabulous island of
St. John out at sea, and the real St. John, now
Prince Edward, is in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.
On this subject Hakluyt appears to have been
confused. In his <i>Principal Navigations</i> (iii. 625)
he speaks of “the isle of Iohn Luis or John
Alverez in 41;” and in a marginal note says,
“This is a very commodious Isle for us on our
way to Virginia.” On page 627 he defines the
position further, saying: “From Bermuda to
the Isle of St. Iohn Luis or John Alverez 320
[leagues]. From the Isle of Iohn Luis or Alverez
to Flores 320.” This appears to have been
one of the flying islands. See <i>Magazine of American
History</i>, viii. 510; <i>The Northmen in Maine</i>,
p. 139. See also Harrisse’s <i>Cabots</i>, p. 275.</p>

Mr. Murphy, in his <i>Voyage of Verrazzano</i>,

Here, indeed, it may prove of interest to
give their respective descriptions of the same
region. Vumenot writes: “La terre n’est pas
fort haute, elle est bien labouree, et est garnie
de ville et Chasteaux, ilz adorent le Soliel et la
lune. D’icy tourne la coste au sud-sudoest et au
sud, jusque un cap qui est haute terre, et ha une
grand isle de terre basse, et trois ou quatre petits
isles.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">This is a description of Cape Cod and the
neighboring coasts, which, in the verse of Maillard,
appear in the same way:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfp8q">“Ils ont chasteaux et villes quilz decorent<br />
Et le Soliel et la lune ilz adorent<br />
En ce pays leur terre est labouree<br />
Non terroy hault mais assez temperee<br />
Dicy la coste ainsy comme jai sceu<br />
Au susseroest elle tourne aussy au su<br />
Plus de cent lieux et jusque au cap va terre<br />
Qui se congnoist en une haulte terre<br />
Qui a vne isle en terre basse grande<br />
Et troys ou quatre isleaux a sa demande<br />
Et de ce cap a lisle se dit.”</p>

<p class="pfc4">Harrisse says that Maillard based his description
upon the manuscript of Allefonsce, and
not on the printed work, saying that the former
was “begun in 1544 and finished in 1546;”
whereas the manuscript itself shows that it was
“finished the 24th day of November, 1545.” It
is also said that Francis I., for whom Maillard
wrote, died March 31, 1547, while the <i>Voyages
avantureux</i> did not appear until 1559, which
seems to have been the case; yet the verses
agree with the printed work instead of the
manuscript of Allefonsce, and bear no relation
to the manuscript other than that borne by the
book. We speak here, of course, only of that
part of Maillard’s performance given in <i>Jean et
Sébastien Cabot</i>. In several cases Maillard makes
a point not in the book; as, for instance, where
(line 131) he says of the Norumbega peltry,&mdash;</p>

<p class="pfp8q p1">“De maint marchant bien cherement requise;”</p>

<p class="pfn4">but this statement is not found in the manuscript
of Allefonsce itself. That Maillard wrote these
verses describing our coast after the corresponding
portion of <i>Voyages avantureux</i> had been
composed, might seem to be indicated by the
fact that the substance of a line omitted after
line 28 is found in the prose version of 1559, as
follows: “Tous le gens ceste terre ont queue,”
which is an allusion to the old story told in the
manuscript of Allefonsce, who says that towards
the north, “in some of these regions are people
with pig’s tails and faces,”&mdash;a statement which
the printed work reduces so as to read, “All
the people of this land have <i>queue</i>.” This was
overlooked by the poet or transcriber.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The connection between Maillard’s work and
the printed narrative is curious, for the two
pieces show a common origin, while two different
writers, independently of one another, could
not have produced two versions so much alike;
though it should be noted that at line 138
Maillard spoils the sense by writing “vne isle,”
instead of “une grand ville,” as in the printed
book,&mdash;unless, indeed, he intended to discredit
the story of the “great city” of Norumbega,
which Allefonsce in his manuscript simply styles
“une ville.” There is no necessity for supposing
that Maillard ever saw the manuscript of Allefonsce.
He may have used the manuscript of
the printed volume of 1559, if it was in existence
in the time of Francis. It certainly was
written March 7, 1557, when the printing was
authorized. It is a curious fact that in 1578
one Thomas Mallard, or Maillard, published an
edition of Allefonsce at Rouen: <i>Les voyages
avantvreux dv Capitaine Iean Alfonce, Sainctongeais:
Contenant les Reigles &amp; enseignmens
necessaires a la bonne &amp; seure Nauigation. Plus
le moyen de se gouuerner, tart enuers les Barbares,
qu’autres nations d’vne chacune contrée, les sortes
de marchandises qui se trouuent abondamment
à icelles: Ensemble, ce qu’on doit porter de petit
prix pour trocquer avec iceux, afin d’en tirer
grand profit. A Rouen, chez Thomas Mallard,
libraire: pre le Palais deuant l’hostel de ville</i>,
1578. Evidently Jehan Maillard, the poet, had
some unexplained connection with the volume
that appeared in 1559.</p>

One thing must strike the student in going
through these topics; namely, the indifference
shown by the respective navigators and explorers
to their predecessors. Cartier makes no
reference to Verrazano, and Allefonsce pays no
attention to Cartier. So far as the writings of
Allefonsce go, it would hardly appear that any
such person as Cartier ever existed. Of Roberval
himself, the pilot of Saintonge makes
but a single mention in passing, while Maillard
speaks of Cartier only in a dedication.</p>

“I can write nothing else vnto you of any

The contents of this globe have not been
published. Though Cartier is not recognized,
we read, “Terra Francesca;” and on the northern
border of Labrador, “<span class="smcap">TERRA PER BRITANOS
INVENTA</span>.” Another Spanish globe&mdash;say of
1540&mdash;gives no trace of Cartier. It seems to be
a fact that Spaniards were sent to search the
Gulf of St. Lawrence after Cartier’s voyages;
while Le Blanc, <i>Les voyages fameux</i>, etc. (Paris,
1649, part iii. p. 63), referred to by Charlevoix,
tells us that the St. Lawrence was visited by
Velasco the Spaniard in 1506.</p>

The <i>Cosmographie</i> says: “Passing about
twenty leagues west-northwest along the coast,
you will find an island, called St. Jean, in the
centre of the district, and nearer to the Breton
region than to Terra Nova. This entry to the
Bretons is twelve leagues wide, and in 47° 30′
north. From St. Jean’s Island to Ascension
[Assumption] Island, in the Canadian Sea, it is
forty leagues across, northwest-by-west. St. Jean
and Bryon and Bird Island are 47° north.” A
little farther on he says: “Southeast of Cape
Ratz [Race] there are two lost islands, which
are called Isle St. Jean, D’Estevan,&mdash;lost because
they consisted of sand.” He also mentions the
Isle of St. Brandon, and “a large island called
the Seven Cities, forming one large island, and
there are many persons who have seen it as
well as myself, and can testify; but I do not
know how things look in the interior, for I
did not land upon it. It is in 28° 30′ north
latitude.”</p>

Another of the Rotz maps (no. 104 in the
Kohl Collection) is similar to the eastern part
of the map here given as “Western Hemisphere;”
but the passage to the west, south
of Labrador (Greenland?), is not so distinctly
closed. There is a strong resemblance to this
map in a French manuscript map in the British
Museum, marked <i>Livre de la marine du Pilote
Pastoret</i> [perhaps Pasterot or Pralut], <i>l’an 1587</i>,
which is also in the Kohl Collection, no. 110.</p>

A full account of this map will be found in
Vol. III. chap. i. Since that chapter was written,
Harrisse has stated (<i>Cabots</i>, p. 153) that the
French Government paid M. de Hennin in 1844
four hundred francs for this map (cf. <i>Essai sur la
Bibliothèque du Roi</i>, Paris, 1856, p. 285). It has
also within a year been photographed full size,
with the legends, and copies of the photographs
have been placed in nine American libraries
(cf. <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc</i>., xix. 387, and xx. 39

There is in the Kohl Collection (no. 107)
a copy of a manuscript Portuguese map in the
British Museum, which Kohl puts at about 1575.
A legend on it says: “On the 20th November,
1580, a Portuguese, Fernando Simon, lent this
map to John Dee in Mortlake, and a servant
of Dee copied it for him.” It shows the coast
from Cape Breton to Hudson’s Straits, giving
the St. Lawrence gulf (with the Newfoundland
group of islands), but not the river. Dee does
not seem to have followed it.</p>

[It was while crossing one of these portages,
“suffering more from the mosquitoes than their
burdens,” that Champlain is supposed to have
lost his astrolabe; and his Journal shows that
his subsequent records of latitude in the journey
failed of the general accuracy which characterized
his earlier entries. At least an astrolabe, with an
inscription of its Paris make, 1603, was dug up
on this route in August, 1867. Cf. O. H. Marshall,

[The book is extremely rare. Field says a
collector may pass a lifetime without seeing it.
In 1870, when the Quebec edition of Champlain
was issued, the editors got their text from a copy
in the Bibliothèque Impériale at Paris, which
they believed to be unique. There are, however,
copies in Harvard College Library (lacking signature
G) and in the Carter-Brown Library
(<i>Catalogue</i>, vol. ii. no. 25). The Lenox Library
has a copy without date, which seems to be
from different type, and shows some typographical
changes. Cf. Harrisse, nos. 10 and 11;
Brunet, <i>Supplément</i>, p. 241; Sabin, vol. iii. no.
11,834; Leclerc, <i>Bibliotheca Americana</i> (1878,

Leclerc, no. 2,696, priced at 1,500 francs); but
most copies are dated 1620, with the engraved
title sometimes retaining the 1619 date (Dufossé,

[The publisher’s name varies in different
copies. The Boston Public Library copy (with
the map in fac-simile) has “chez Pierre Le Mur
dans le grand Salle du Palais.” The Library of
Congress copy reads “Lovis Sevestre pres la
porte St. Victor.” One of the Harvard College
copies has “chez Clavde Collet;” the other is a
Le Mur copy. Other copies are in the Boston
Athenæum (lacking the map), the New York
Historical Society, and the State Library at
Albany. Two copies have been lately sold in
America, one in the <i>Brinley Catalogue</i> (no. 76),
and the other in the <i>O’Callaghan Catalogue</i> (no.
572, $130), both with the map, which was supplied
in fac-simile in a second O’Callaghan copy (no.
573), now in the Boston Public Library. The
Sunderland copy (no. 2,687) had the map, which
is often wanting. Dufossé (no. 8,236) held a
copy with the genuine map at 650 francs, and
other copies (nos. 5,551 and 8,961) with the map
in fac-simile, at 450 and 550 francs. Leclerc
priced one (no. 695) with a fac-simile map at
750 francs, and (no. 2,697) with “l’avis au lecteur”
lacking, at 1,000 francs. Quaritch advertised
one with a fac-simile map at £36. Cf.
Sabin, vol. iii. no. 11,839; Brunet, <i>Supplément</i>,
p. 242.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Some of the copies known have a passage at
the end of the first paragraph on page 27, which
was held to be a reflection on Richelieu, in saying
that statesmen or princes might not understand
the sailing of a ship, and this led to the
cancelling of sheets Dij and Diij (Stevens’s
<i>Nuggets</i>, vol. i. no. 511; Field, <i>Indian Bibliography</i>,
no. 268). One of these copies is in the
Lenox Library; and one with, and another without,
the passage are in the Carter-Brown Library
(vol. ii. nos. 382 and 383).</p>
<p class="pfc4">Harrisse (nos. 50, 51) says that Champlain
was at the date of this publication in Canada,
that the book was doubtless made up by a compiler,
and that the record of 1631 was furnished
from another source than Champlain. Whoever
arranged it abridged, omitted, and extended
with an author’s license. Mr. O. H. Marshall
believes that the book and the map never passed
under Champlain’s supervision (<i>Mag. of Amer.
Hist.</i>, i. 5, 6).</p>
<p class="pfc4">This issue of 1632 was reissued in 1640, with a
new title, and of this date there are copies in the
Lenox and Carter-Brown libraries. Sabin says
that Mr. Lenox suggests that this 1640 edition
probably consists of rejected copies of the 1632
edition, since the cancelled, and not the substituted,
leaves are in it, and these bear the marks
of having been cut through with a sharp instrument
(Sabin, vol. iii. no. 11,840, who says that
Mr. Lenox contributed most of his data on the
Champlain bibliography). Leclerc in 1878 advertised
a set of the four dates (1604, 1613, 1620,
and 1632), bound uniformly, for 6,000 francs.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

[This island, now known as Douchet Island,
is a few miles within the mouth of the St.
Croix River, which empties into Passamaquoddy
Bay. In the latter part of the last century, when
the commissioners of Great Britain and the
United States were endeavoring to define the
St. Croix River, which by treaty had been fixed
as the eastern bound of the new nation, this
island played an important part. The maps
were not conclusive respecting the historic St.
Croix, some of them, like that of Bellin in
Charlevoix’s <i>History</i> (1744), rather indicating
the Magaguadavic River, on the eastern side
of the bay; but the discovery in 1797 of the
foundation-stones of De Monts’s houses on this
island, with large trees growing above them,
settled the question. The island bears evidence
of having considerably wasted by the wash of
the river, and its few acres are at present hardly
large enough for the purpose it served in 1604.
It is known that then the colonists resorted to
the main shore for their planting. The island
now has a cottage upon it, which bears aloft a
small light, to aid river navigation, and is maintained
by the United States Government, the
deepest water being on the easterly side. The
Editor examined the island in 1882, but could
not find that any traces of De Monts’s colony
now remained, though fragments of “French
brick” were found there by William Willis

According to a careful census taken in
1686, the whole population of Acadia was 915,
including 30 soldiers; and there were in the
whole colony 986 horned cattle, 759 sheep, and
608 swine. (Murdoch’s <i>History of Nova Scotia</i>,
i. 166, 167.) In 1689 the census gave the whole
population as 803. (<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 177.) Commenting
on the almost stationary condition of the
colony for nearly a century, Murdoch justly
remarks: “It is a subject of grave reflection,
that after eighty-four years had elapsed from
the founding of Port Royal in 1605, and notwithstanding
the expense of money and all the exertions
of De Monts, Poutrincourt, La Tour, Denis,
and others, men highly qualified for the task of
colonization, the results should be so trifling.
Many of the settlements were now desolate and
abandoned, and none of them prosperous.
Nearly forty years before, D’Aulnay had besieged
St. John with a flotilla and five hundred
men, and the defenders had been probably numerous.
The contests and discords of ambitious
leaders contributed, doubtless, to this unfavorable
state of things; but the incessant interferences
and invasions which the English at
Boston carried on, must be considered as the
chief causes of retarding the progress of French
settlement in Acadia.”</p>

[Among those whom the treaty of Breda
released from military service at Quebec, was
the colonel of a
regiment, Jean Vincent,
Baron de St.
Castine, who now
took to life among
the Indians, and
became the son-in-law
of Madockawando,
or Matakando, the chief sachem of the
Eastern Indians. He afterward lived on the peninsula
still bearing his name, near the head of
Penobscot Bay, at Fort Pentagöet,&mdash;a defence
which the French had built as early probably as
1626, on the site possibly of an earlier fort,
which may date to the time of the Guercheville
expedition in 1613. Some traces of Fort Pentagöet
still remain, representing probably the
magazine and well. The English surrendered it
to the French in 1670.In 1674 a pirate ship
from Boston captured the post and took De
Chambly and others
prisoners.
(Frontenac, Quebec,
Nov. 14, 1674,
to the minister, in
<i>Massachusetts Archives;
Documents
Collected in France</i>, ii. 287, 291.) A Dutch
frigate captured the fort in 1676. Castine in
later years made Pentagöet the base of many
warlike movements, in league with his Indian
friends, against the English, till his return to
France in 1708, when he left the “younger Castine,”
a half-breed, behind, who is also a character
of frequent prominence in later days. Cf.
Wheeler’s <i>History of Castine</i>; Williamson’s
<i>Maine</i>, i. 471, etc. (with references); <i>Maine Hist.
Coll</i>. iii. 124, vi. 110, and vii., by J. E. Godfrey,
who also has a paper on the younger Castine in
the <i>Historical Magazine</i>, 1873. Cf. <i>Maine Hist.

[Kohl (<i>Discovery of Maine</i>, p. 234) thinks
that the name <i>Larcadia</i> appeared first in Ruscelli’s
map of 1561. The origin of the name
<i>Acadie</i> usually given is a derivation from the
Indian <i>Aquoddiauke</i>, the place of the pollock
(<i>Historical Magazine</i>, i. 84), or a Gallicized rendering
of the <i>quoddy</i> of our day, as preserved in
Passamaquoddy and the like. Cf. Principal
Dawson on the name, in the <i>Canadian Antiquarian</i>,
October, 1876, and <i>Maine Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>

tenant sa boutique sur les degrez de la grand’
salle du Palais. 1609. 8vo. pp. 888.</p>
<p class="pfc4">[Lescarbot was in the country with De Monts,
and again with Poutrincourt in 1606-7. Charlevoix
calls his narrative “sincere, well-informed,
sensible, and impartial.” The third book covers
Cartier’s voyage; the fourth and fifth cover
those of De Monts, Poutrincourt, Champlain,
etc.; while the sixth is given to the natives.
The first edition (1609) is very rare. Rich in
1832 priced it at £1 1<i>s.</i> Recent sales much exceed
that sum: Bolton Corney, in 1871, £27;
Leclerc, no. 749, 1,200 francs, and no. 2,836, 450
francs; Quaritch, £40; another London Catalogue,
in 1878, £45. Cf. Harrisse, <i>Notes sur la
Nouvelle France</i>, nos. 16 and 17; Sabin’s <i>Dictionary</i>,
no. 40,169; Ternaux-Compans, <i>Bibl.
Amér.</i> no. 321; Faribault, pp. 86-87. There are
copies in the Carter-Brown (<i>Catalogue</i>, ii. 87)
and Murphy collections.</p>
<p class="pfc4">This edition, as well as the later ones, usually
has bound with it a collection of Lescarbot’s
verses, <i>Les Muses de la Nouvelle France</i>, and
among them a commemorative poem on a battle
between Membertou, a chief of the neighborhood,
and the “Sauvages Armor-chiquois.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">The later editions of the history were successively
enlarged; that of 1618 much extended,
and of a different arrangement. The edition of
1611 is priced by Dufossé, 580 francs. There
are copies in the Library of Congress, and in the
Murphy and Carter-Brown (<i>Catalogue</i>, ii. 117)
collections; cf. Harrisse, no. 23.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The edition of 1612 was the one selected by
Tross, of Paris, in 1866, to reprint. There are
copies in the Astor and Harvard College Libraries;
cf. Harrisse, no. 25; Field’s <i>Indian Bibliography</i>,
no. 917; <i>Brinley Catalogue</i>, no. 103. It
seems to be the same as the 1611 edition, with
the errata corrected.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The edition of 1618 contains, additionally,
the second voyage of Poutrincourt; and entering
into his dispute with the Jesuits, Lescarbot
takes sides against the latter. This edition is
severally priced by Leclerc, no. 2,837, at 850
francs; by Dufossé, at 950 francs. Rich had
priced it in 1832 at £1 10<i>s.</i> There are copies
in the Library of Congress and in the Carter-Brown
(<i>Catalogue</i>, ii. 201) Collection; cf. Harrisse,
no. 31; Field’s <i>Indian Bibliography</i>, no.
915. Some authorities report copy or copies
with 1617 for the date.</p>
<p class="pfc4">It is somewhat doubtful if more maps than
the general one and another appeared in the
original 1609 edition; Sabin and the <i>Huth Catalogue</i>
give three. In the 1611 edition there is
reference in the text to three maps; but another
map (Port Royal) is often found in it, and the
1618 edition has usually the four maps. The
<i>Huth Catalogue</i> says that no map belonged to
the English edition; the map found in the
Grenville copy, as in the Massachusetts Historical
Society copy, belonging to the French original.
Sabin, however, gives it a map. The
general map is reproduced in Tross’s reprint, in
Faillon’s <i>Colonie Française au Canada</i>, and in
the <i>Popham Memorial</i>; and a part of it in the
<i>Memorial History of Boston</i>, i. 49. The <i>Catalogue</i>
of the Library of Parliament (Canadian),
1858, p. 1614, shows two maps of the St. Lawrence
River and gulf, copied from originals by
Lescarbot in the Paris archives.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Among the other productions of Lescarbot is
the <i>La Conversion des Sauvages qui ont été baptistes
dans la Nouvelle France cette anne 1610, avec un
recit du Voyage du Sieur de Poutrincourt</i>, which
Sabin calls “probably the rarest of Lescarbot’s
books;” cf. Harrisse, no. 21. Another tract,
published in Paris in 1612&mdash;<i>Relation derniere de
ce qui c’est passe au voyage du Sieur de Poutrincourt
en la Nouvelle France depuis vingt mois en
ça</i>, supplementing his larger work&mdash;has been
reprinted in the <i>Archives curieuses de l’Histoire
de France</i>, vol. xv. In 1618 he printed a tract&mdash;<i>Le
Bout de l’an, sur le repos de la France, par le
Franc Gaulois</i>&mdash;addressed to Louis XIII., urging
him to the conquest of the savages of the
west; <i>Sunderland Catalogue</i>, no. 4,933, £10, 10<i>s.</i>
It is translated in Poor’s Gorges in the <i>Popham
Memorial</i>, p. 140.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Another nearly contemporary account of the
De Monts expedition is found in Cayet’s <i>Chronologie
Septenaire</i> 1609 (Sabin’s <i>Dictionary</i>, vol. iii.
no. 11,627) a precursor of the <i>Mercure Française</i>,
which for a long while chronicled the yearly
events. Cf. an English version from the <i>Mercure</i>
in <i>Magazine of American History</i>, ii. 49.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Lescarbot’s account of the natives may be
supplemented by that in Biard’s <i>Relation</i>. Hannay
(chap. ii.) and the other historians of Acadia
treat this subject, and Father Vetromile, S. J., at
one time a missionary among the present remnants
of the western tribes of Acadia, prepared
an account of their history, which was printed
in the <i>Maine Hist. Coll.</i>, vol. vii.; and in 1866
he issued the <i>Abnakis and their History</i>. He
died in 1881, and his manuscript <i>Dictionary of
the Abenaki Dialects</i> is now in the archives of
the Department of the Interior at Washington;
<i>Proceedings of the Numismatic Society of Philadelphia</i>,
1881, p. 33; cf. also Maurault, <i>Histoire
des Abênaquis</i>. Williamson, <i>History of Maine</i>,
vol. i. ch. xvii., etc., enlarges on the tribal varieties
of the Indians of the western part of Acadia,
and (p. 469) on the Etechemins, or those
east of the Penobscot; and later (p. 478), on
the Micmacs or Souriquois, who were farther
east. Williamson’s references are useful.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Shea, in his notes to <i>Charlevoix</i>, i. 276,
says: “Champlain says the Kennebec Indians
were Etechemins. Their language differed from
the Micmac. The name Abenaki seems to have
applied to all between the Sokokis and the St.
John; the language of these tribes, the Abenakis
or Kennebec Indians, the Indians on the
Penobscot and Passamaquoddy, being almost
the same.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

vi. of Lescarbot’s larger work; but it has been
noted as a curious circumstance that the author’s
name does not appear on the titlepage, and is
nowhere mentioned in the volume. There are
two copies in the library of the Massachusetts
Historical Society: one in the general library
contains Lescarbot’s map, and has manuscript
notes by the late Rev. Dr. Alexander Young;
the other copy, in the Dowse Library, formerly
belonged to Henri Ternaux-Compans. It is
without the map, but contains the Preface and
Table of Contents, which are not in the copy
first mentioned. It is from the same type, but
has a slightly different titlepage and imprint;
the Dowse copy purporting to be published at
London by George Bishop, and bearing the date
1609. It was a common practice of the printers
of that time to sell copies of the same work with
different titlepages, each containing the name of
the bookseller who bought the printed sheets.</p>

<i>Memorials of the English and French Commissaries
concerning the Limits of Nova Scotia
or Acadia.</i> London: Printed in the Year 1755.
8vo. pp. 771.</p>
<p class="pfc4">[This volume is said to have been drawn up
by Charles Townshend (Bancroft, original ed.,
iv. 100), and is fuller than the corresponding
work previously issued in Paris under the title,
<i>Mémoires des Commissaires du Roi et de Ceux de
sa Majesté Britannique sur les Possessions et les
droits respectifs des deux Couronnes en Amerique</i>.
4 vols. 4to. Paris, 1755. Another edition of
this last appeared the next year in 8 vols. 12mo,
and again in three thick but small volumes at
Copenhagen in 1755 (<i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>,
vol. iii. no. 1074, etc.). The English edition above
named contains the English case (both in English
and French), signed W. Shirley and W.
Mildmay, and dated at Paris, Sept. 21, 1750; and
the French, signed by La Galissonière and De
Silhouette, and dated the same day. Then follows
the English memorial of Jan. 11, 1751, with
the French reply (Oct. 4, 1751), and the English
rejoinder (Jan. 23, 1753). In these papers the
maps cited and examined are the English maps
of Purchas, Berry, Morden, Thornton, Halley,
Popple, and Salmon, the Dutch maps of De
Laet and Visscher, and the French maps of
Lescarbot, Champlain, Hennepin, De Lisle, Bellin
and Danville, De Fer (1705) and Gendreville
(1719). The rest of the volume is made of
“Pièces Justificatives” brought forward by
each side. There were maps accompanying
these respective editions, setting forth the limits
as claimed by the two sides, and marking by
lines and shadings the extent of the successive
patents of jurisdiction which follow down the
region’s history. Jefferys and Le Rouge were
the engravers on the opposing sides. John
Green was the writer of the <i>Explanation</i> accompanying
the Jefferys map. There was another
edition in English of the case, printed at the
Hague in 1756, under the title, <i>All the Memorials
of Great Britain and France since the Peace
of Aix-la-Chapelle</i>.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The contemporary literature of the controversy
is extensive, and it all goes over the historical
evidence in a way to throw much light,
when separated from partisanship, on the history
of Acadia. It may be said to have begun with
a work mentioned by Obadiah Rich, <i>A Geographical
History of Nova Scotia</i>, London, 1749 (Sabin,
<i>Dictionary of Books Relating to America</i>, vol.
xiii. no. 56,135), of which a French translation
was published also in London (<i>Carter-Brown
Catalogue</i>, vol. iii. no. 1,064), and a German one
the next year.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Jefferys printed in 1754, <i>The Conduct of the
French with regard to Nova Scotia, from its First
Settlement to the Present Time</i>; and this appeared
in a French version in London (<i>Conduite
des François</i>) in the same year, with notes said to
be written by Butel-Dumont.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The next year, Dr. William Clarke, of Boston,
also reviewed the historical claims from the
discovery of Cabot, in his <i>Observations ... with
regard to the</i> [French] <i>Encroachments</i>, Boston,
1755,&mdash;a tract also reprinted in London. There
may be likewise noted Pidansat de Mairobert’s
<i>Discussion summaire sur les anciennes limites de
l’Acadie</i>, printed at Basel, 1755 (<i>Carter-Brown
Catalogue</i>, vol. iii. no. 1,035); Moreau’s <i>Mémoire</i>,
Paris, 1756; and Jefferys’ <i>Remarks on the French
Memorials</i>, London, 1756. The last has two
maps, setting forth respectively the French and
English ideas and claims of the various occupancies
and settlements under grant and charter;
the French map is reduced from the original of
the commissioners, and it may also be found in
the <i>Atlas Ameriquain</i> published at this time.
At a later period, when the identity of De Monts’
St. Croix became an international question, the
folio <i>Correspondence relating to the Boundary
between the British Possessions in North America
and the United States of America, under the
Treaty of 1783</i>, was presented to Parliament
July, 1840, and included an historical examination
of the question, with maps and drafts from
Lescarbot’s, Delisle’s, and Coronelli’s maps. Cf.
in this connection Nathan Hale’s review of the
history in the <i>North American Review</i>, vol. xxvi.
In Shea’s edition of <i>Charlevoix</i>, i. 248, there is
a note on the various limits assigned by early
writers to Acadia.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p class="pfc4">[Mr. Slafter devotes a section of his monograph
to the bibliography of his subject. Alexander’s
tract, <i>Encouragement to Colonies</i>, which
was printed in London in 1624 (some copies in
1625), and of which the unsold copies were reissued
in 1630 as <i>The Mapp and Description of
New England</i>, is printed entire by Slafter. The
book is rare. Stevens, <i>Nuggets</i>, no. 59, prices it
at £21; cf. Sabin’s <i>Dictionary</i>, nos. 739, 740. The
map which accompanied both editions is given
by Slafter, and in part in Vol. III. of the present
work, and has been reproduced elsewhere, as
Slafter (p. 124) explains. Hazard, <i>Collections</i>,
i. 134, 206, prints some of the documentary
evidence, and the British Museum <i>Catalogue of
Manuscripts</i> shows that the Egerton Manuscripts,
2,395, fol. 20-26, also touch the subject. In further
elucidation, see Thomas C. Banks, <i>Statement
of the Case of Alexander Earl of Stirling</i>,
London, 1832, and his <i>Baronia Anglia Concentrata</i>,
1844, and the various expositions of the
claims to the earldom in the several works referred
to by Slafter, p. 115; and also Rogers,
<i>Memorials of the Earls of Stirling and House of
Alexander</i>, i. chaps. iv. and v. Mr. Slafter subsequently
enlarged his statement regarding the
<i>Copper Coinage of the Earl of Stirling</i>, and issued
it as a tract with this title in 1874. Mr. C. W.
Tuttle reviewed Mr. Slafter’s labors in <i>N. E.

<p class="pfc4">James Hannay’s <i>History of Acadia</i>, St. John,

<i>Pioneers of France in the New World.</i> By

1865. 8vo. pp. xxii and 420. [Mme. de Clermont-Tonnere
has translated this and other of
Mr. Parkman’s works, but with liberties prompted
no doubt by disagreements in matters of religious
faith. The <i>Pioneers</i> was the earliest,
chronologically, in the series of <i>France and England
in North America</i>,&mdash;a general title under
which Mr. Parkman has already told a large
part of the story of the French colonization in
North America; but a later subject, the struggle
of the Indians under Pontiac after the final English
conquest, had before this engaged his pen.
The characterization of later volumes of this series
belongs to other chapters, in which will also
be found further estimates of the other general
historians here particularized. The Abbé Casgrain
published at Quebec in 1872 an essay on
<i>Francis Parkman</i>, pp. 89, with a lithographic
portrait. Cf. a review by the Comte Circourt in

Le Jeune to Vimont, in the <i>Relation</i> of
1640, writes: “Some Frenchmen call them the
‘Nation of Stinkers,’ because the Algonquin
word <i>Ouinipeg</i> signifies ‘stinking water.’ They
thus call the water of the sea. Therefore these
people call themselves ‘Ouinipegous,’ because
they come from the shores of a sea of which
we have no knowledge; and we must not call
them the Nation of Stinkers, but the ‘Nation of
the Sea.’”</p>
<p class="pfc4">In the <i>Jesuit Relations</i> of 1647-48 is the following:
“On its shores [Green Bay] dwell a different
people of an unknown language,&mdash;that is to
say, a language neither Algonquin nor Huron.
These people are called the Puants, not on account
of any unpleasant odor that is peculiar to
them, but because they say they came from the
shores of a sea far distant toward the west, the
waters of which being salt, they call themselves
the ‘people of the stinking water.’”</p>

Outaouacs, or Ottawas, was a name applied
to all the upper Indians who came to Montreal
or Quebec to trade. The <i>Relation</i> of 1671 gives
the origin of the name: “We have given the
name of Outaouacs to all the savages of these
countries, although of different nations, because
the first who have appeared among the French
have been Outaouacs.” Francis Assikinach, an
Indian, published in 1858-60, various papers on
the Odahwah legends and languages in the
<i>Canadian Journal</i>.</p>

Duchesneau, Intendant of Canada, describes
the Ottawas in these words: “The Outawas
Indians, who are divided into several tribes,
and are nearest to us, are those of the greatest
use, because through them we obtain beaver;
and although they do not hunt generally, and
have but a small portion of peltry in their country,
they go in search of it to the most distant

[There is a portrait of Talon in the Hotel
Dieu at Quebec. It is engraved in Shea’s <i>Charlevoix</i>,
iii., and <i>Le Clercq</i>, ii. 61. His instructions
are dated March 27, 1665. His eagerness was
not altogether satisfactory to Colbert, who warns
him, April 5, 1666, that the “King would never
depopulate his kingdom to people Canada.”
Talon in return (<i>Mass. Archives: Docs. Coll. in
France</i>, ii. 189, 195), advocated the purchase of
New Netherland, so as to confine the English to
New England; but the English were about settling
that question their own way.</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>A mémoire (1667) sur l’état présent du Canada</i>,
probably by Talon, is in Faribault’s <i>Collection de
Mémoires sur l’histoire ancienne du Canada</i>, Quebec,
1840. Faillon (vol iii. part iii.) enlarges
upon the zeal of Louis XIV. for the colony. The
Bishop of Quebec meanwhile had his apprehensions.
He warns the home government against
allowing Protestants to come out. “Quebec is
not very far from Boston,” he says, “and to multiply
the Protestants is to invite revolution.”

This may be the Péré, or Perray, whose name
is given on Franquelin’s map of 1688 to the
Moose River of Hudson’s Bay. Bellin says that
it was named after a Frenchman who discovered
it. In 1677 the Sieur Péré was with La Salle at
Fort Frontenac. Frontenac, in November, 1679,
writes to the King that Governor Andros of
New York “has retained there, and even well
treated, a man named Péré, and others who
have been alienated from Sieur de la Salle, with
the design to employ and send them among
the Outawas, to open a trade with them.” The
Intendant, Duchesneau, writes more fully to
Seignelay, “that the man named Péré, having
resolved to range the woods, went to Orange to
confer with the English, and to carry his beavers
there, in order to obtain some wampum beads
to return and trade with the Outawacs; that he
was arrested by the Governor of that place, and
sent to Major Andros, Governor-General, whose
residence is at Manatte; that his plan was to
propose to bring to him all the <i>coureurs de bois</i>
with their peltries.” After this he seems to have
been “a close prisoner at London for eighteen
months” (<i>N. Y. Col. Doc.</i>, iii. 479). Governor
Dongan, on Sept. 8, 1687, sends Mons. La Parre
to Canada “with an answer to the French Governor’s
angry letter.” Nicholas Perrot in the old
documents is sometimes called Peré, and this
has led to confusion.</p>

Father Allouez, the first Jesuit to visit
Green Bay, writes: “We set out from Saut [Ste.
Marie] the 3d of November [1669], according
to my dates; two canoes of Ponteouatamis
wishing to take me to their country, not that I
might instruct them, they having no disposition
to receive the faith, but to soften some young
Frenchmen who were among them, for the purpose
of trading, and who threatened and ill-treated
them.”</p>

The “Procès Verbal” of Talon, as given
by Margry and Tailhan, mentions fourteen
nations; among others: 1. Achipoés [Ojibways
or Chippeways]; 2. Malamechs; 3. Noquets;
4. Banabeoueks [Ouinipegouek, or Winnebagoes?];
5. Makomiteks; 6. Poulteattemis [Pottowattamies];
7. Oumalominis [Menomonees];
8. Sassassaouacottons [Osaukees or Sauks?];
9. Illinois; 10. Mascouttins. The Hurons and
Ottawas, at a later period, conferred with the
French and assented to the treaty; and this
would account for Talon’s assertion, as given
in his report quoted in the text, that there were
seventeen tribes.</p>

Mount Joliet is about sixty feet in height.
The summit is two hundred and twenty-five feet
wide, and thirteen hundred long. It is forty
miles southwest of Chicago, in the vicinity of
the city of Joliet, Illinois.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_481_481" id="Footnote_481_481"></a><a href="#FNanchor_481_481"><span class="label">[481]</span></a></span>
Joliet, in his letter written on the map prepared
for Frontenac, speaks of passing the years
1673 and 1674 in explorations of the Mississippi
valley. [See this letter in fac-simile on a later
page.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>
<p class="pfc4">At the conclusion of his note to Frontenac,
he alludes to the disaster which happened a
quarter of an hour before his arrival at the
point from which, in September, 1672, he had
departed, in these words: “I had avoided perils
from savages, I had passed forty-two rapids,
and was about to land, with full joy at
the success of so long and difficult an enterprise,
when, after these dangers, my canoe upset.
I lost two men and my box (<i>cassette</i>)
in sight of, at the door of, the first French
settlements which I had left almost two years
before.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">Marquette conveys the impression that Joliet
returned with him to Green Bay in September,
1673; but when, in a few weeks, he went back to
the Illinois country between Chicago and Lake
Peoria, he found several Frenchmen trading
with the Indians, and among others mentions
La Taupine, or Pierre Moreau, who in 1671
was with Joliet at Sault Ste. Marie. Near one
of the upper tributaries of the Illinois on Joliet’s
map appears Mont Joliet. May Joliet not
have traded in this vicinity during the winter
of 1673-1674, and may not Taupine and others
have been his associates?</p>

He probably established the post near the
Sioux at the portage of the St. Croix River,

Tonty had been ordered to raise a party of
Illinois and attack in the rear, while Denonville
was charging in front; but he could not find
enough men, and therefore joined Du Lhut, his

La Hontan writes: “I am to go along
with M. Dulhut, a Lyons gentleman, and a
person of great merit, who has done his King
and his country very considerable service.
M. de Tonti makes another of our company.”
Joutel in his Journal mentions that Tonty
reached his post in the Illinois country October
27, 1687.</p>

The post at Wisconsin River was called
Fort St. Nicholas, suggested by Perrot’s baptismal
name. In August, 1683, Engelran wrote
to Governor de la Barre from Mackinaw: “M. de
Boisguillot fulfils faithfully the duties of the position
which has been assigned him during the
absence of those who are under your command.”
Le Sueur says St. Croix River was called from
a Frenchman, and it is thought the River St.
Pierre was named in compliment to Pierre Le
Sueur.</p>

An excellent bibliographical summary of
the sources of the history of these early Western
explorations, by Mr. A. P. C. Griffin, appeared in
the <i>Magazine of American History</i>, 1883, also separately.
The account of the sources of La Salle’s
discoveries given in Edouard Frère’s <i>Manuel du
Bibliographe Normand</i> is scant. Mr. John Langton’s
paper on “The Early Discoveries of the
French in North America,” printed in <i>The Canadian
Journal</i>, 1857, p. 393, enumerates some of
the early maps. Dr. George E. Ellis’s “French
Explorations in the West,” in the <i>North American
Review</i>, cx. 260, is a review of Parkman; and
J. H. Greene’s “Early French Travellers in the
West,” in <i>Ibid.</i>, xlviii. 63, is a review of Sparks’s
<i>Life of Marquette</i>, which is one of the volumes
of his <i>American Biography</i>.</p>

A heliotype of it is given in the note on

the “Jesuits’ map of Lac Supérieur;” but he

Parkman thinks that La Salle crossed the Chicago
portage and struck the upper waters of
the Illinois, but did not descend that river,
and suggests that the map called in a later
sketch “The Basin of the Great Lakes” is indicative
of this extent of La Salle’s exploration
in the mere beginning of the Illinois River which
it gives. Others reject the “Histoire” altogether,
as Hurlbut does in his <i>Chicago Antiquities</i>,
p. 250, not accepting Parkman’s view that
La Salle was at Chicago in 1669 and 1670. Dr.
Shea holds it was the St. Joseph’s River which
La Salle entered.</p>

Gravier gave a colored fac-simile of it in connection
with his essay, and the same fac-simile is

He repeated this fac-simile later in his

and better renderings are in the <i>Historical Magazine</i>,
August, 1861, and in part ii. p. 277, etc.,
of French’s <i>Historical Collections of Louisiana</i>,
accompanied by a fac-simile of a map by Delisle
showing the routes of the early explorers. This
section of Thevenot was reprinted (125 copies)
in fac-simile, with the map, in Paris in 1845, for
Obadiah Rich. There is a copy of this reprint
in the Sumner collection in Harvard College
Library, and in the Carter-Brown and Lenox
libraries, and the latter library has devoted no.

The contemporary account of Marquette’s
death is given in the <i>Relation</i> of that year, and
in the “Récit de la mort du P. Marquette,” as
published in the <i>Mission du Canada</i>. Cf. Shea’s
<i>Charlevoix</i>, iii. 182, note; but Charlevoix’ account
varies, and Parkman says it is a traditionary
one, and that traces of the tradition were
not long since current (<i>La Salle</i>, p. 72). Cf.
“Romance and Reality of the Death of Marquette,
and the Recent Discovery of his Remains,”
by Shea, in the <i>Catholic World</i>, xxvi.
267, and “Father Marquette’s Bones” in the
<i>Canadian Antiquarian</i>, January, 1878. In
1877 some human bones were found on the
supposed site of the mission chapel at St. Ignace.
Of Marquette’s successors in the Illinois
mission, see Shea’s <i>Catholic Missions</i>, App.,
and <i>Wisconsin Historical Society’s Collections</i>,

The claim was reinforced by Judge John
Law in a paper on “The Jesuit Missionaries in
the Northwest,” printed in the <i>Wisconsin Historical
Collections</i>, vol. iii., with replies and rejoinders;
Dr. Shea taking issue with him in a paper
called “Justice to Marquette,” which originally
appeared in the <i>Catholic Telegraph</i>, March 10,
1855. Parkman credits Shea also with a refutation
in the <i>New York Weekly Herald</i>, April 21,
1855. The Jesuits alleged to have been on the
affluents of the Mississippi thus early were Dequerre,
Drocoux, and Pinet.</p>

Parkman, <i>La Salle</i>, p. 169. This first vessel
of the lakes has been the subject of some
study. Hennepin gives a view of her building
in his <i>Voyage curieux</i>, 1711 edition, etc., p. 100.
Mr. O. H. Marshall has published, as no. 1 of
the publications of the Buffalo Historical Society,
a tract of thirty-six pages, called <i>The
Building and Voyage of the “Griffin,”</i> printed in
1879, giving in it a map of Niagara and its
vicinity in 1688. Margry prints (i. 435) a “Relation
des découvertes et des voyages du Sieur
de la Salle, 1679-1681,” which he calls the Official
Report of the transactions of this period made
to the minister of the marine, and thinks it drawn
up from La Salle’s letter by Bernou, and that
Hennepin used it. Shea considers the question
an open one, and that the Report may perhaps
have been borrowed from Hennepin. A note
on Hennepin and his contributions to the historical
material of this period is on a later page.</p>

The principal portages by which passage
was early made by canoes from the basin of the
lakes to that of the Mississippi were five in
number:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc4">1. By Green Bay, Lake Winnebago, and the
Fox River to the Wisconsin, thence to the Mississippi,&mdash;the
route of Joliet.</p>
<p class="pfc4">2. By the Chicago River, at the southwest of
Lake Michigan, to the Illinois, thence to the
Mississippi. This appears in the earliest maps
of Joliet and Marquette, and is displayed in the
great 1684 map of Franquelin, of this part of
which Parkman gives a drawing in his <i>La Salle</i>,
which with various later ones is repeated in
Hurlbut’s <i>Chicago Antiquities</i>.</p>
<p class="pfc4">3. By the St. Joseph River, at the southeast
corner of Lake Michigan, to the Kankakee, and
so to the Illinois. This was La Salle’s route.</p>
<p class="pfc4">4. By the St. Joseph’s River to the Wabash
(Ouabache); thence to the Ohio and Mississippi.</p>
<p class="pfc4">5. By the Miami River from the west end of
Lake Erie to the Wabash; thence to the Ohio
and Mississippi.</p>
<p class="pfc4">A paper by R. S. Robertson in the <i>American
Antiquarian</i>, ii. 123, aims to show that this last
portage was known to Allouez as early as 1680,
and had perhaps been indicated by Sanson in his
map of Canada as early as 1657. It would
seem to have been little frequented, however, because
of the danger from the Iroquois parties, but
was reopened in 1716. Regarding La Salle’s
connection with this portage, see a letter by Mr.
Parkman quoted by Baldwin in his <i>Early Maps
of Ohio</i>, p. 7, and letters of La Salle in Margry’s
<i>Découvertes</i>, etc. Cf. H. S. Knapp’s <i>History of
the Maumee Valley from 1680</i>, Toledo, 1872 (P.
Thomson’s <i>Bibliography of Ohio</i>, no. 681). The
southern shore of Lake Erie was the latest
known of all the borders of the great lakes.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Margry in his fifth volume has two papers on
the routes of these early explorers,&mdash;“Postes
de la route des Lacs au Mississipi (1683-1695),”
and “Postes dans les Pays depuis le Lac Champlain
jusqu’au Mississipi (1683-1695).” The
series of the Great Lakes show the following
heights above tide-level at New York: Ontario,
247 feet; Erie, 573 feet; Huron and Michigan,
582 feet; Superior, 602 feet. The Mississippi
at St. Paul is 80 feet above Superior.</p>

this site in a long note in his <i>La Salle</i>, p. 223.</p>

There is some dispute about the origin of
this name. Le Clercq says it was so designated
“on account of many vexations experienced
there;” others say it was a reminiscence by
Tonty of the part he had taken in the siege of
Crèvecœur in the Netherlands. Cf. Shea’s
<i>Hennepin</i>, p. 175.</p>

groups together various contemporary estimates
of La Salle’s discovery, including the accusations
of Duchesneau (p. 265), and the defence of La
Salle (p. 277) by a friend, addressed to Seignelay,

to grow from it, in a letter dated at “Missilimakanak,

Parkman has given an abstract (<i>La Salle</i>
p. 458) of the pretended discoveries of Mathieu
Sagean, who represents that he started at this time
with some Frenchmen from the fort on the Illinois
on an expedition in which he ascended the
Missouri to the country of a King Hagaren, a
descendant of Montezuma, who ruled over a
luxurious people. The narrative is considered
a fabrication. Mr. E. G. Squier found the manuscript
in the Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris,
and bringing home a copy, it was printed by Dr.
Shea, with the title, <i>Extrait de la relation des

of the vexatious delays in the departure
of the expedition and of La Salle’s difficulties
(pp. 421, 454, etc.), together with his final letters

This map is still preserved in the Archives
Scientifiques de la Marine, and a sketch of it is
in the text. Thomassy (p. 208) cites it as “Carte
de la Louisiane avec l’embouchure de la Rivière
du S<sup>r</sup> de la Salle (Mai, 1685), par Minet,” and
giving a sketch, calls it the complement of
Franquelin. Shea thinks it was drawn up from
La Salle’s and Peñalosa’s notes. Cf. Shea’s
<i>Peñalosa</i>, p. 21; Harrisse, <i>Notes</i>, etc., nos. 225,
227, 228, 256-258, 260, 261, 263, who says he could
not find on it the date, Mai, 1685, given by Parkman
and Thomassy; Gravier, <i>La Salle</i>; and
Delisle, in <i>Journal des Savans</i>, xix. 211. Margry
(ii. 591) prints some observations of Minet
on La Salle’s effort to find the mouth of the
Mississippi.</p>

Harrisse, no. 750. The book is rare; there
are copies in the Boston Public, Lenox, Carter-Brown

<p class="pfc4">The book should have a map entitled <i>Carte
nouvelle de la Louisiane et de la Rivière de Mississipi
... dressée par le Sieur Joutel</i>, 1713. A
section of this map is given in the <i>Magazine of
American History</i>, 1882, p. 185, and in A. P. C.
Griffin’s <i>Discovery of the Mississippi</i>, p. 20.</p>
<p class="pfc4">In 1714 an English translation appeared in
Paris, as <i>A Journal of the last Voyage perform’d
by Monsr. de la Sale to the Gulph of Mexico, to
find out the Mouth of the Mississipi River; his
unfortunate Death, and the Travels of his Companions
for the Space of Eight Hundred Leagues
across that Inland Country of America, now call’d
Louisania, translated from the Edition just publish’d
at Paris</i>. It also had a folding map showing
the course of the Mississippi, with a view
of Niagara engraved in the corner. Cf. Harrisse,

iii. no. 55; Brinley, no. 4,498 (with date 1715).
There are copies in the Boston Public, the
Lenox, and Cornell University libraries. This
1714 translation was issued with a new title in
1719 (Carter-Brown, vol. iii. no. 244; Field, no.
809), and was reprinted in French’s <i>Historical
Collections of Louisiana</i>, part i. p. 85. A Spanish
translation, <i>Diario historico</i>, was issued in New
York in 1831. Dumont’s <i>Mémoires historiques
sur la Louisiane</i>, Paris, 1753, with a map, was
put forth by its author as a sort of continuation
of the Journal published by Joutel in 1713.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Shea speaks of Hennepin’s <i>Nouveau Voyage</i>
as “a made-up affair of no authority.” It is
translated in French’s <i>Historical Collections of

a different story at different times. <i>La Salle</i>,

Shea printed it from Parkman’s manuscript
in 1858, and translated it, with notes,
in his <i>Early Voyages up and down the Mississippi</i>.
It is called <i>Relation du voyage entrepris
par feu M. Robert Cavelier, Sieur de la Salle....Par
son frère, M. Cavelier, l’un des compagnons
de voyage</i>. Shea says of it in his Charlevoix,
iv. 63, that “it is enfeebled by his
acknowledged concealment, if not misrepresentation;
and his statements generally are attacked
by Joutel.” Cf. Margry, ii. 501.</p>

career among manuscripts may read R. H.
Major’s Preface (pp. xxiv-li) to his <i>Life of
Prince Henry of Portugal</i>, London, 1868. Mr.
Major has clearly got no high idea of M.
Margry’s acumen or honesty from the claim
which this Frenchman has put forth, that the
instigation of Columbus’s views came from
France. Cf. Major’s <i>Select Letters of Columbus</i>,

This was not the only missionary labor in
New France during the period already noticed.
In 1619 some Recollect Fathers of the province
of Aquitaine in France, at the instance of a
fishing company which had establishments on
the Acadian coast, came over to minister to the
French and labor among the Indians. Their
field of labor included Nova Scotia, New Brunswick,
and Gaspé; but of the results of their attempts
to instil an idea of Christianity into the
minds of the Micmacs, we can give no details.
One of their number, Father Sebastian, perished
in the woods in 1623, while on his way from his
post at Miscou to the chief mission station on
St. John’s River. Three surviving Fathers joined
the Recollects at Quebec in 1624 by order of
their provincial in France, and took part in their
ministry till Kirk arrived.</p>

for his harsh judgment of Sagard. The original
is now rare and costly. Tross, before securing
a copy to print from, kept for years a standing

Quaritch, in 1880, prices it at £63; and Le Clerc

gives 1,200 francs. Dufossé (<i>Americana</i>, 1876

[This translation, of which only 250 copies
were printed, was made by Dr. Shea. He introduces
it with “A Sketch of Father Christian
Le Clercq,” which includes a bibliographical account
of his works. The book supplements in
a measure Sagard’s <i>Histoire du Canada</i>, since
that had given the earlier labors as this portrays
the later works of the Recollects, or at least
more minutely than Sagard. The Recollects had
been recalled to Canada to thwart the Jesuits,
and Le Clercq reached Quebec in 1673, and was
assigned in 1675 to the vicinity of the Bay of
Gaspé as a missionary field; and it is of his
labors in this region that we learn in his <i>Nouvelle
relation de la Gaspésie</i>, which was printed in
Paris in 1691 (cf. Harrisse, <i>Notes</i>, 170; Field,
<i>Indian Bibliography</i>, 902; Ternaux, 176; Faribault,
82; Lenox, in <i>Historical Magazine</i>, ii. 25;
Dufossé, <i>Americana</i>, 1878, 75 and 100 francs;
Sabin, vol. x. p. 159; Stevens, <i>Bibliotheca Historica</i>,
1870, no. 1,113; <i>Brinley Catalogue</i>, 102;
Le Clercq, <i>Bibl. Amer.</i>, 746, 140 francs; Carter-Brown,
vol. ii. no. 1,415; O’Callaghan, no. 1,360),
and Le Clercq refers his readers to the present
work for a continuation of the story, but it does
not contain it, that portion being suppressed, as
Dr. Shea thinks. The Jesuits are bitterly satirized
by Le Clercq in the concluding part of the
first volume, and in the second of the <i>Établissement</i>.
Shea’s collation of the <i>Nouvelle Relation</i>
does not correspond with the Harvard College
copy, which has 28 instead of 26 preliminary
leaves. See also Sabin’s <i>Dictionary</i>, vol. x. no.
39,649; Field’s <i>Indian Bibliography</i>, no. 903;
Harrisse, <i>Notes sur la Nouvelle France</i>, no. 170;
Boucher de la Richarderie, vi. 21; Faribault,
p. 82.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The original edition of the <i>Établissement</i> had
two varieties of title, one bearing the author’s
name in full, and the other concealing it by initials.
It is very rare with either title, but copies
can be found in the Carter-Brown Library (see
<i>Catalogue</i>, no. 1,413), and in the Sparks Collection
at Cornell University (see <i>Sparks Catalogue</i>,
no. 1,482). Dr. Shea notes other copies in Baron
James Rothschild’s library at Paris, and in the
Abbé H. Verreau’s collection at Montreal. Mr.
Stewart tells me there are copies in the libraries
of Laval University, of the Quebec Government,
Of the Literary and Historical Society of Quebec,
and of Parliament, at Ottawa. The Leno
Library has a copy of what seems the same edition,
with the title changed to <i>Histoire des colonies
françoises</i>, Paris and Lyons, 1692. Mr.
Lenox (<i>Historical Magazine</i>, January, 1858), following
Sparks and others, claimed that the 1691
edition was suppressed; but Harrisse (<i>Notes</i>, etc.
p. 159) disputes this in a long notice of the book,
in which he cites <i>Œuvres de Messire Antoine Arnould</i>,
Paris, 1780, xxxiv. 720, to the contrary.
Le Clercq’s book should have a map, “Carte
generalle de la Nouvelle France,” which is given
in fac-simile in vol. ii. of this translation. It
includes all North America, except the Arctic
regions, but, singularly, omits Lake Champlain.</p>
<p class="pfc4">President Sparks wrote in his copy: “An
extremely rare book.... It is peculiarly valuable
as containing the first original account of
the discoveries of La Salle by two [Recollect]
missionaries who accompanied him. From this
book, also, Hennepin drew the account of his
pretended discovery of the Mississippi River.”
See the bibliographical notice in Shea’s <i>Discovery
and Explorations of the Mississippi Valley</i>, p. 78.
Sparks, in his <i>Life of La Salle</i>, first pointed out
how Hennepin had plagiarized from the journal
of Father Membré, contained in Le Clercq. See
further in Shea’s <i>Mississippi Valley</i>, p. 83 <i>et seq.</i>,
where Membré’s journal in Shea’s translation
from Le Clercq was printed for the first time, and
the note on Hennepin, following chap. viii. of the
present volume. Harrisse, <i>Notes</i>, etc., p. 160,
points out what we owe to this work for a knowledge
of La Salle’s explorations. Cf. Parkman’s
<i>La Salle</i>; Field’s <i>Indian Bibliography</i>, no. 903,
with a note touching the authorship; Brunet,
<i>Supplement</i>, i. 810, noting copies sold,&mdash;Maisonneuve,
250 francs; Sóbolewski, 150 thalers;
Tross (1873), 410 francs; Dufossé, 600 francs;
Le Clercq, no. 2,833, 1,500 francs.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The bibliographers are agreed that others
than Le Clercq were engaged in the <i>Établissement</i>,
and that the part concerning Frontenac
was clearly not by Le Clercq. Charlevoix says
Frontenac himself assisted in it; and it is Shea’s
opinion that extraneous matter was attached to
Le Clercq’s account of the Recollect missions, to
convert the book into an attack in large part on
the Jesuits.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

The aims of partisanship always incite the
detraction of rivals, and a story which is current
illustrates the passions of rivalry, if it does not
record the truth. Faillon’s book is said to have
given offence to the members of the Seminary
at Quebec, and to have restored some of the old
recriminating fervor which so long characterized
the relations of the ecclesiastics of Montreal and
Quebec. The priests of the Seminary are even
credited with an appeal to the Pope to prevent
the continuance of its publication. Whether
this be true or not, historical scholarship is accounted
a gainer in the antidote which the
Quebec ecclesiastics applied, when they commissioned
the Abbé Laverdière, since deceased,
to publish his edition of Champlain.</p>

In the Preface to his <i>Old Régime</i>, and repeated
in his <i>Frontenac</i>, Mr. Parkman, in referring
to his conclusions, said: “Some of the results
here reached are of a character which I regret,
since they cannot be agreeable to persons for
whom I have a very cordial regard. The conclusions
drawn from the facts may be matter of opinion;
but it will be remembered that the facts themselves
can be overthrown only by overthrowing the
evidence on which they rest, or bringing forward
counter evidence of equal or greater strength.”
The chief questioner of Parkman’s views has
been the Abbé Casgrain, whose position is best
understood from his <i>Une Paroisse Canadienne au
XVII<sup>e</sup> siècle</i>, Quebec, 1880. See Poole’s <i>Index</i>,
p. 973, for reviews of Parkman’s books.</p>

There are copies of the 1597 edition in the Carter-Brown and Harvard College libraries. They are worth
from £3 to £4. Copies of the 1598 edition are in the Library of Congress, and in the Murphy, Barlow, and
Carter-Brown Collections. It is usually priced at $8 or $10. This edition was reissued in 1603 with a new
title, and the omissions of the leaf of “epigramma;” and copies of this date are in the Library of Congress, the
Philadelphia Library, and in the Carter-Brown Collection. A French edition, including the same maps, appeared
at Douay in 1607, with the text abridged in parts and added to in others. There is a copy in the Carter-Brown
(<i>Catalogue</i>, ii. 59) Collection. The maps were also reproduced, with four others not American, in the 1611
edition of Douay, of which the Library of Congress, Harvard College, and the Carter-Brown Collections have
copies. The <i>America, sive novus orbis</i> of Metellus, published at Cologne in 1600, has twenty maps, which are
reduced copies with little change from Wytfliet. (Rich, 1832, no. 90; Sabin, <i>Dictionary</i>, xii. 48,170). Harvard
College Library has a copy of Metellus.</p>

Part of this famous map is given on p. 373. See Raemdonck’s <i>Mercator</i>, pp. 114-138, 249. The same
map was reproduced on a different projection by Rumold Mercator in 1587, and by Corneille de Jode in 1589;
and Guillaume Jannsonius imitated it in 1606, and this in turn was imitated by Kaerius. Girolamo Poro reproduced
it at Venice on a reduced scale in 1596.</p>
<p class="pfc4">German and English writers have disputed over the claim for the invention of what is known as Mercator’s
projection. The facts seem to be that Mercator conceived the principle, but did not accurately work out the
formula for parallelizing the meridians and for spreading the parallels of latitude. Mead, on <i>The Construction
of Maps</i> (1717), charged Mercator with having stolen the idea from Edward Wright, who was the first to publish
an engraved map on this system in his <i>Certaine Errors of Navigation</i>, London, 1599. It seems, however,
clear that Wright perfected the formula, and only claimed to have improved, not to have invented, the projection.
Raemdonck (p. 120) gives full references.</p>

Dr. J. van Raemdonck published <i>Gérard Mercator, sa Vie et ses Œuvres</i>, in 1869; a paper in the nature
of a supplement by him, “Relations commerciales entre Gérard Mercator et Christophe Plautin à Anvers,” was
published in the <i>Bull. de la Soc. géog. d’Anvers</i>, iv. 327. There is a succinct account of Mercator by Eliab
F. Hall published in the <i>Bulletin</i> (1878, no. 4) of the American Geographical Society. Raemdonck (p. 312)
has shown that the old belief in the Latinization of Koopman, or Kaufmann, as the original name of Mercator,
is an error,&mdash;his family name having been Cremer, which in Flemish signified the German Kaufmann and the
Latin Mercator. Raemdonck also shows that Mercator was born in the Pays de Waas, March 5, 1512.</p>

This had 153 plates, but none touching New France, except the map of the world. The same, with German
text, appeared in 1609. About twenty editions appeared in various languages; but that of 1627-1628
showed 140 newly engraved maps, of which there were later Dutch (1630) and Latin (1634) editions. In 1651,
this <i>Atlas minor</i> was increased to two volumes, with 211 maps, having 71 (including five new maps of South
American regions) additional maps to the 140 of the 1627-1628 edition. Cf. Raemdonck, <i>Mercator; Carter-Brown

Cf. Lelewel, <i>Epilogue</i>, p. 229. “The progress of geographical science long continued to be slow,” says
Hallam in his <i>Literature of Europe</i>. “If we compare the map of the world in 1651, by Nicolas Sanson,
esteemed on all sides the best geographer of his age, with one by his son in 1692, the variances will not appear
perhaps so considerable as one might have expected.... The Sanson family did not take pains enough to improve
what their father had executed, though they might have had material help from the astronomical observations
which were now continually made in different parts of the world.” The Sanson plates continued to be
used in Johannes Luyt’s <i>Introductio ad Geographiam</i>, 1692, and in the <i>Atlas nouveau par le Sr. Sanson et
H. Jaillot</i>, published in Paris about the same year.</p>

Cf. the map on the title of the <i>Beschryvinghe van Guiana</i>, Amsterdam, 1605 (given in Muller’s <i>Books on
America</i>, 1872). The map in Cespedes’ <i>Regimiento de Navigacion</i>, Madrid, 1606, is of interest as being
one of the few early printed Spanish maps. This, like those in Medina, Gomara, and Herrera, is of a small
scale. The map in so well-known a book as Herrera’s <i>Descripcion de las Indias</i> (1601, repeated in the 1622
edition) is very vaguely drawn for the northeastern part of America. The map in the <i>Detectio freti Hudsoni</i>,
published at Amsterdam in 1613, showed as yet no signs of Champlain’s discoveries.</p>

Harrisse, no. 327. Sanson had already published a map of North America in 1650 (Harrisse, no. 325).
As contemporary maps, reference may be made to a map of Nicolosius (Harrisse, no. 268); and to one in Wright’s
<i>Certain Errors in Navigation</i>. Harrisse (no. 336) refers to a later map of Sanson (1667), before his son
published his revision in 1669.</p>

Similar delineations of these western lakes appear on various maps of about this time, including those
credited to Valck and F. de Witt, and others marked “P. Schenk, ex.,” and “per Jacobum de Sandrart,
Norimbergæ, B. Homann sculpsit.” Guillaume Sanson embodied the same representations in his <i>Amérique
septentrionale</i> in 1669 (Harrisse, no. 338), and the next year (1670) they again appeared on the map attached to
Blome’s <i>Description of the World</i>. Still later they are found in Jaillot’s <i>Amérique septentrionale</i> (1694); in
the map in Campanius’ <i>Nya Swerige</i> (1702), and even so late as 1741 in Van der Aa’s <i>Galerie agréable du

Brodhead made his first report on his work in

he had arranged and indexed his eighty volumes,
also in an address before the New York Historical
Society, 1844, printed in their <i>Proceedings</i>.
This led to the arranging and binding of
two hundred volumes of the domestic archives,
which had been in disorder. The eighty volumes
above named were divided thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc4">Sixteen, 1603-1678, obtained in Holland;
forty-seven, 1614-1678, procured in England;
seventeen, 1631-1763, secured in Paris. Brodhead’s
<i>New York</i>, i. 759; <i>Westminster Review</i>,
new series, iii. 607.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Asher, <i>Essay</i>, p. xlviii, says of Brodhead’s
mission: “We must, however, regret that, tied
down by his instructions, he took a somewhat
narrow view of his search, and purposely omitted
from his collection a vast store of documents
bearing on the history of the West India Company.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">The documents as published were divided
thus: Vol. i. Holland documents, 1603-1656.
Vol. ii. Ibid., 1657-1678. Vol. iii. London documents,

[It is often claimed that the map of Lok
(see page 40 of Vol. III.) showing the Western
Sea of Verrazano, and published in 1582, instigated
Hudson to make search for it along the
shore of New Netherland. Hudson’s voyage of
1609 is known as his third voyage. (Cf. a note
to Mr Smith’s chapter in Vol. III. on “Explorations
to the Northwest.”) The question of
the impelling cause of this voyage is examined
by Bancroft in his <i>United States</i>, vol. ii. chap. 15;
by H. C. Murphy in his <i>Henry Hudson in Holland</i>,
Hague, 1859; and by J. M. Read, in his
<i>Henry Hudson, his Friends, Relatives, and Early
Life</i>, Albany, 1866, which last work has an appendix
of original sources.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The old narrative of Ivan Bardsen, which it
is supposed was used by Hudson as a guide, is
given in Rafn’s <i>Antiquitates Americanæ</i>, in Purchas’s
<i>Pilgrimes</i>, in the appendix of Asher’s
<i>Hudson</i>, and the English of it is given in De
Costa’s <i>Sailing Directions of Hudson</i> (reviewed
in the <i>Historical Magazine</i>, 1870, p. 204), which is
accompanied by a dissertation on the discovery
of Hudson River. Cf. also Major’s Introduction
to the <i>Zeni Voyages</i>, published by the Hakluyt
Society.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Moulton, in his <i>New York</i>, gives a running
commentary on Hudson’s passage up the river.
See also the conclusions of Gay in the <i>Popular
History of the United States</i>, i. 355. We learn
the most of this voyage from Purchas’s <i>Pilgrimes</i>
(also <i>N. Y. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, 1809, vol. i.), whose
third volume contains the accounts by Hudson
and his companions; and in the <i>Pilgrimage</i> there is
a chapter on “Hudson’s Discoveries and Death,”
which is mainly a summary of the documents in
the <i>Pilgrimes</i>. This is reprinted by Asher in his
<i>Henry Hudson the Navigator</i> (Hakluyt Society),
where will also be found, page 45, what is known
as Juet’s Journal, March-November, 1609 (also
in Purchas, iii. 581; Munsell’s <i>Annals of Albany</i>,
and in 2 <i>N. Y. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, i. 317; also cf.
ii. 367), with extracts from Lambrechtsen’s <i>New
Netherland</i>, who used material not otherwise
known, and from De Laet’s <i>Nieuwe Wereld</i>, and
in the Appendix a bibliography of the voyage.
De Laet used Hudson’s own journals (April 19,
1607-June 21, 1611), which are not now known
and what De Laet gives of the third voyage is
supposed to be Hudson’s own report. Asher, p.
167-172, claims that the matter given by Van der
Donck and not found elsewhere was fabricated
to support the Dutch claim. The controversial
papers of Dawson and Whitehead, in the <i>Historical
Magazine</i>, 1870, touch many of the points
of Hudson’s explorations. Brodhead’s <i>New
York</i> and O’Callaghan’s <i>New Netherland</i> give
careful studies of this voyage. The latest developments,
however, did not serve Biddle in
his <i>Cabot</i>; nor Belknap in his <i>American Biography</i>;
nor R. H. Cleveland in Sparks’s <i>American
Biography</i>; nor Miller in the <i>N. Y. Hist.
Soc. Coll.</i>, 1810. The chief Dutch authority is
Emanuel van Meteren, of whose work mention
is made later in the text. (Cf. Asher’s <i>Hudson</i>,
p. xxv; compare also a <i>Collection of Voyages
undertaken by the Dutch East India Company</i>,

edition was priced by Muller in 1872 at ten
florins. There is a copy in Charles Deane’s
library. The 1630 edition, called “verbetert,
vermeerdert, met eenige nieuwe Caerten verciert,”
has fourteen maps, engraved chiefly by
Hessel Gerritsz, and good copies are worth
about six to eight guineas. The 1633 edition
was priced by Rich in 1832 at one pound ten
shillings, but a good copy of it will now bring
about five guineas. The 1640 edition has appreciated
in the same time from one pound four
shillings (Rich, in 1832) to two guineas. Translations
of such parts as pertain to New Netherland
are in the <i>N. Y. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, new series,

Hon. Jer. Johnson, in the preface to his
translation of Van der Donck (<i>N. Y. Hist. Soc.
Coll.</i>, 1841), says “Van Rensselaer had arrived
five years before Van der Donck.” This is an
error. Kilian van Rensselaer, the first patroon,
was never in America; and when by his death,
1646, the title to Rensselaerswyck devolved upon
his infant son Johannes, the child’s paternal
uncle, Johann Baptist van Rensselaer, undertook
the personal management of the colony, but did
not arrive in America as the first representative
here of the family until 1651. O’Callaghan, in
<i>History of New Netherland</i>, ii. 550, states that Van
der Donck was not allowed to practise law in
New Netherland, because “the directors could
not see what advantage his pleadings before the
courts would have, as there were already lawyers
in New Netherland,” etc. This is also an error.
See <i>N. Y. Coll. MSS.</i>, xi. 86, where the application
is refused “because they doubted whether
there were any other lawyers who could act or
plead against him.” Van der Donck was here
from 1641 to 1655, when he died.</p>

<p class="pfc4">[The general <i>Indian Bibliography</i> of T. W.
Field must be held to indicate the sources of
information regarding the condition of the natives
at the time of the Dutch occupation. Bolton,
in his <i>West Chester County</i> (1848), endeavors
by a map to place the Indian tribes as they occupied
the territory bordering the southern parts
of the Hudson. Dunlap, <i>New York</i>, i. 20, gives
a map showing the territory of the Five Nations.
Dr. O’Callaghan translated in 1863 a paper in
the State archives, entitled <i>A Brief and True
Narration of the Hostile Conduct of the Barbarous
Natives towards the Dutch Nation</i>, dated 1655, and
gave the Indian treaty of 1645 in an appendix.
Fifty copies only were printed (Field, no. 1,147).
Judge Egbert Benson published in 1817, 1825,
and in the <i>N. Y. Hist. Coll.</i>, vol. vii., an essay
on the Dutch and Indian names, of which a
copy, with his manuscript additions, exists in
Harvard College Library.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The most important of the works of the last
century is Cadwallader Colden’s <i>History of the
Five Nations</i>, originally printed at New York
in 1727. The second and third editions were
printed in London, and the English editors gave
additions without distinguishing them. The best
issue is the fourth, printed in New York in 1866,
exactly following the 1727 one, and enriched
with notes by John G. Shea, who gives also its
bibliographical history. (Field, no. 341.) The
first place among recent books on this confederacy
must be assigned to Lewis H. Morgan’s
<i>League of the Iroquois</i>. (Field, no. 1,091.) There
is more or less illustrative of the early state of
the Indians in Ketchum’s <i>Buffalo</i> (1864), for the
Five Nations, as described in Field, no. 824; in
Benton’s <i>Herkimer County</i> (1856), for the Upper
Mohawk tribes. See also J. V. H. Clark’s
<i>Onondaga</i> (1849), praised by Field, no. 323;

These two parties were originally divided
on theological questions; Gomar’s followers adhering
to the religious doctrines of the Established
Church and its principles of ecclesiastical
polity, while Arminius (Harmansen), professor
at Leyden, taught, among other doctrines then
considered heretical, the supremacy of the civil
authorities in clerical matters. Oldenbarnevelt,
believing that the Prince of Orange intended to
make himself King of Holland, although indifferent
in religious matters, took the part of the
Arminians, because he saw in them a powerful
ally, and turned the theological controversy into
a political question.</p>

Lieuwe van Aitzema, son of the Burgomaster
of Dockum, born 1600, and himself in high
official position, died 1669. Michaud, <i>Bibliographie
Universelle</i>, says: “Ce qui donne une
si haute importance à l’ouvrage d’A. c’est cette
foule d’actes originaux, ...dont il a fait usage
et qu’il a su tirer des archives et des dépôts les
plus secrets [not always by quite proper means].”
Wiquefort, in his <i>Ambassadeur</i>, criticises Aitzema
sharply: “Elle [l’histoire d’A.] peut servir
comme d’inventaire à ceux qui n’ont point d’accès
aux archives d’État, mais ce que l’auteur a
ajouté ne vaut pas la gazette. Il n’a point de
style, son langage est barbare, et tout
l’ouvrage n’est qu’un chaos.” However,
he deserves our gratitude for
throwing light upon the events of his
time, and for giving us trustworthy and
abundant information.</p>

160. Doubts have been raised whether such a
grant was ever made, or if made, whether it was
ever acted upon by Sir Edmund; but the statement
of Van der Donck in his <i>Vertoogh van
Nieuw Nederland</i> should dispose of such doubts
forever. When Sir Edmund came to New Netherland
he was poor and in debt, without friends
to help him; and seeing that the Dutch had a

that he returned to Virginia, saying he would

William Smith, Jr. was born in New York
city in June, 1728; he graduated at Yale College
in 1745; was appointed clerk of the Court of
Chancery in 1748, and admitted to the Bar in
1750. Through the influence of his father, then
attorney-general of the province, the revision of
the provincial laws was intrusted to him and his
law partner, William Livingston. In 1757 he
published his <i>History of New York</i>. The breaking
out of the Revolution found him a member
of the council and a faithful adherent of the
Crown. After some tribulation, he was allowed
to proceed to New York city, whence he finally
went to England, and thence to Canada, where
he died as chief-justice in 1793. [Cf. the estimate

Dunlap, for instance, lets Schenectady be
planted shortly after Fort Orange, in 1614, and
considers the remnants of foundations found in
Trinity Church-yard to indicate the location of
the first Dutch fort on Manhattan Island, while
they must have been the remnants of the city
wall, running from the East River, along the

Dr. Edmund Bailey O’Callaghan was born
at Mallow, near Cork, Ireland, in 1797. After
studying medicine in his native country and in
Paris, he came to Canada in 1823, where he soon
took an active part in politics on the patriots’
side. He was compelled to fly to the United
States, and settled at Albany in 1837. Here he
worked diligently in the field of American history,
with results most gratifying to the student,
until 1870, when he removed to New York,
where he died in 1880.</p>
<p class="pfc4">[Dr. O’Callaghan’s <i>New Netherland</i> is divided
thus: Book i., 1492-1621; ii., 1621-1638; iii.,
1639-1647. He also printed a few copies of the
<i>Register of New Netherland</i>, 1626-1674, giving
the names of the pioneers. John G. Shea printed
an account of O’Callaghan in the <i>Magazine of
American History</i>, v. 77. The <i>Catalogue</i> of his

[From 1659 to 1672 it was issued with
Spanish text, ten volumes, but not including
the American parts; in 1662 to 1665, with Latin
text, eleven volumes, the last devoted to America,
usually with twenty-three maps; in 1663,
in French, twelve volumes; in 1664 to 1665 in
Dutch, but somewhat abridged. (Cf. Asher’s
<i>List</i>, Muller’s <i>Catalogue</i>, Armstrong’s <i>Fort
Nassau</i>, p. 7, on the map of 1645 particularly.)
Muller says of this final edition: “The part
treating of America may be regarded as the first
atlas of what is now the United States, in the
same sense as Wytfliet may be called the first
special atlas of America in general.” He afterwards
added a <i>Theatrum Urbium</i>. The younger
Blaeu also issued, in 1648, an immense map of
the world in two hemispheres, twenty-one sheets.

Mr. Muller pays a warm tribute to Asher and his <i>Essay</i> in his <i>Catalogue</i> (1872), no. 1,052. “I always
believed this book,” he says, “to be a striking example of what intuition and discernment, combined with great
zeal, can do.” (Cf. Harrisse, <i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>, p. xxxvi.) Asher’s book may be supplemented by P. A. Tiele’s
<i>Bibliotheek van Nederlandsche pamfletten</i>, 1858-1861, based on Muller’s collection, which gives 9,668 Dutch
pamphlets published 1482-1702, adding to Asher’s enumeration many others relating to America; and again
the Dutch-American student will find further help from J. K. van der Wulf’s <i>Catalogus van de Tractaten
in de bibliotheek van Isaac Meulman</i>, Amsterdam, 1866-1868, three vols.,&mdash;a privately printed book in a
collection now in the library of the University of Gand. (Muller’s <i>Catalogue</i> [1872], nos. 108, 114; [1877]
nos. 3,202, 3,566.) These two works show 19,077 pamphlets published in the United Provinces from 1500

It consists of Part I. (1872), books, nos. 1-2,339. Part II. (1875), supplement of books, nos. 2,340-3,534.

consolidated <i>Catalogue of Books and Pamphlets, Atlases, Maps, Plates, and Autographs relating to North and
South America</i>, nos. 1-3,695, which Mr. Muller issued in 1877. In the preface of his 1872 <i>Catalogue</i> Mr. Muller
speaks of his American collection, which formed the basis of Mr. Asher’s <i>Essay</i>; this collection he sold in 1858
to Brockhaus, and another was sold in 1866 to Henry Stevens,&mdash;all of which, as well as later acquisitions, formed
the foundation of his <i>Catalogue</i>. “Since I began my present business,” says Mr. Muller in 1872, “now more
than thirty years ago, my firm conviction has been that the antiquarian bookseller can largely serve science, bibliography,
or literary history especially, without forgetting his own profit.... An antiquarian bookseller who is
not himself a student, or at least desirous of furthering science by the aid of his connections, will hardly be
as successful as he might be in another less scientific calling. Experience has amply shown me that this opinion,
merely a loose impression when I first started in business, was correct.” Mr. Muller was born in Amsterdam,
July 22, 1817, and was early apprenticed to his uncle, a bookseller of that town, and in 1843 he became a bookseller
on his own account, and identified himself thereafter with bibliography. His pupil and friend, Otto Harrassowitz,
printed a memoir of Muller in the German <i>Börsenblatt</i>, no. 48; and there is also a sketch with an
engraved portrait in <i>Trübner’s Literary Record</i>, new series, vol. ii. (1881) no. 1. He died Jan. 6, 1881.</p>

In a letter of the 27th of April, of that
year, Gustavus also commended the project to
the Swedish Lutheran bishops, “the rather,”
says Geijer, “that the Company was to labor
for the conversion of the heathen.” Some popular
verses of the day are cited by the same historian,
attributing the solicitation of the clergy
to invest their funds in the venture to motives
not so pious.</p>

According to Campanius, the Swedish Government
likewise obtained, through Johan Oxenstjerna,
ambassador to King Charles I. of
England, in 1634, the renunciation in their favor
of all pretensions of the English to the territory
afterward known as New Sweden, based on the
right of first discovery,&mdash;a statement “confirmed
by von Stiernman,” says Acrelius, “out
of the official documents, the article of cession
being preserved in the royal archives before the
burning of the palace” of Stockholm in 1697.
Sprinchorn recently searched the archives of
Sweden for official testimony on the subject
without avail, although he “met with the declaration
of Campanius in more than one contemporaneous
instrument.” The succeeding passage
in Campanius, relating to the claims of the Hollanders,
has been grossly mistranslated by Du
Ponceau (misleading Reynolds, the translator of
Acrelius), even to the mentioning of a treaty
confirming the purchase of the Dutch title by
the Swedes, regarding which nothing whatever
appears in the original.</p>

This letter is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc4">Whereas many kingdoms and countries prosper
by means of navigation, and parts of the West
Indies have gradually been occupied by the English,
French, and Dutch, it seems to me that the
Crown of Sweden ought not to forbear to make
also its name known in foreign lands; and therefore
I, the undersigned, desire to tender my services
to the same, to undertake, on a small scale,
what, by God’s grace, should in a short time result
in something great.</p>
<p class="pfc4">In the first place, I have proposed to Mr.
Peter Spiring to make a voyage to the Virginias,
New Netherland, and other regions adjacent,
certain places well known to me, with a very
good climate, which might be named Nova
Suedia.</p>
<p class="pfc4">For this expedition there would be required
a ship of 60, 70, or 100 läster [120, 140, or 200
tons], armed with twelve guns, and sufficient
ammunition.</p>
<p class="pfc4">For the cargo, 10,000 or 12,000 gulden would
be needed, to be expended in hatchets, axes,
kettles, blankets, and other merchandise.</p>
<p class="pfc4">A crew of twenty or twenty-five men would
be wanted, with provisions for twelve months,
which would cost about 3,400 gulden.</p>
<p class="pfc4">In case the Crown of Sweden would provide
the ship with ammunition, with twelve soldiers,
to garrison and hold the places, and likewise
furnish a bark or yacht, for facilitating trade,
the whole [additional] expense might come to
about 1,600 gulden,&mdash;one half of which I myself
will guarantee, Mr. Spiring assuming the
other half, either on his own account or for the
Crown, the same to be paid at once, in cash.</p>
<p class="pfc4">As to the time of sailing, the sooner we start
the better; for, although trade does not begin
till spring, by being on the spot in season, we
can get on friendly terms with the savages, and
induce them to collect as many furs as possible
during the winter, and may hope to buy 4,500 or
6,000 beaver skins, thus acquiring a large capital
from so small a commencement, and the ability
to undertake more hereafter.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The Crown of Sweden might favor the beginners
of this new enterprise with a charter,
prohibiting all other persons from sailing from
Sweden within the limits of <i>Terra Nova</i> and
Florida for the space of twenty years, on pain of
confiscation of ship and cargo. And as it often
happens that French or Portuguese vessels are
met with on the ocean, authority should likewise
be granted to capture such ships, and bring them
as lawful prizes to Sweden. Also, it should be
conceded that all goods of the Company for the
first ten years be free of duty both coming in
and going out.</p>
<p class="pfc4">And, as the said land is suited for growing
tobacco and various kinds of grain, it would be
well to take along proper persons to cultivate
these, who might at the same time be employed
as garrison.</p>
<p class="pfc4">In addition, the advantages to be derived
from the enterprise in course of time by the
Crown of Sweden could be indicated orally by
me, if I were called to Sweden to give a more
detailed account of everything. However, that
shall be as the gentlemen of the Government
see fit.</p>
<p class="pfc4">This is designed briefly to serve your Excellency
as a memorandum. I trust your Excellency
will write an early answer from Sweden to my
known friend [Blommaert?], whether the work
will be undertaken, so that no time be lost, and
others anticipate an enterprise which should
bring so great profit to the Crown of Sweden.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Herewith wishing your Excellency <i>bon voyage</i>,<br />
I remain<br />
Your Excellency’s faithful servant,<br />

It may be proper to note that the Governor
himself does not seem at first to have been satisfied
with the sincerity of the aborigines, and, in
keeping with his former profession of arms,
even appeals in his report of 1644 to the authorities
in Sweden for a couple of hundred soldiers
to drive the savages from the Delaware, arguing
also that the Dutch and English would be more
likely to respect rights acquired from the natives
not merely by purchase, but also by the
sword.</p>

This vessel alone is named in Printz’s reports
of 1644 and 1647. In a communication,
however, of Queen Christina to the Admiralty,
of the 12th of August, 1645, and in her Majesty’s
letter to Captain Berendt Hermanson, of the
8th of the preceding May, preserved in the registry
of the Admiralty in the naval archives of
Sweden, the “Kalmar Nyckel” is mentioned,
with the “Fama,” as having made “the voyage
to Virginia” under the commander named. On
her return this ship met with detention in Holland
similar to that incurred by the “Fama,” but
finally arrived in Sweden with 53,100 pounds of
tobacco. So large a cargo certainly was not
raised in New Sweden (which place, probably,
was not visited by the vessel), and may have
been purchased in the English Virginia. For a
comment on such practices see an extract from
a letter from Directors of the Dutch West India
Company in Holland to Director-General Stuyvesant,
dated Jan. 27, 1649, a translation of
which is printed in <i>Documents relating to the
Colonial History of the State of New York</i>, xii.

Campanius, to be sure, mentions “Korsholm”
as a distinct fort, but he does so in terms
which show that he is citing Lindström, who
speaks of it as on territory granted to Sven
Schute, embracing “Passajungh, Kinsessingh,
Mockorhuttingh, and the land on both sides of
the Schylekijl to the river” Delaware, and makes
no reference to a “Fort Skörkil.” The statements
with regard to the latter were probably drawn
from the manuscripts of his grandfather. It
did not occur to him, I suppose, that the places
might be identical. “Gripsholm” is the name
incorrectly given for “Korsholm” by N. J.
Visscher and later Dutch cartographers.</p>

At “Chinsessingh” (the Indian name of
the land west of the Schuylkill), says Campanius,&mdash;“the
New Fort,” so called, which “was
no fort, but a good log-house, built of strong
hickory, two stories high, and affording sufficient
protection against the Indians.” If the
interpretation usually given to the dates of
Hudde’s report already cited be correct, both
Wasa and Mölndal were occupied by Printz
before November, 1645. The latter post was at
a “place called by the Indians Kakarikonck”
or “Karakung,” near where the present road
from Philadelphia to Darby crosses Cobb’s
Creek.</p>

The expression used in Oxenstjerna’s reply
to Printz’s Report referred to in the next sentence.
Printzdorp, on the west side of the
river Delaware, south of Upland, was doubtless
granted to Printz in accordance with this
petition.</p>

The only one residing in New Sweden
March 1, 1648, was the Reverend Lars Carlson
Lock. Sprinchorn also mentions another Swedish
Lutheran clergyman, “Israel Fluviander,&mdash;Printz’s
sister’s son,” who probably died or returned
home in the spring.</p>

The materials of this narrative being almost entirely
derived from Swedish sources, the dates
have not been altered from the Julian calendar,
which was still used in Sweden. The news
referred to in the text was brought by Augustine
Herman, who had dealings with Governor Printz
upon the Delaware, and for some account of
whom see the <i>Pennsylvania Magazine of History</i>,

In view of conflicting interests of the
West India Company, adverse claims of other

of Passajung, Rising declined to sanction

Directors of the Dutch West India Company to
Director-General Stuyvesant, dated Oct. 16 and
30, 1663 (<i>Doc. Col. Hist. N. Y.</i>, xii. 445-46), lest
an expedition, which had sailed from Sweden
under Admiral Hendrick Gerritsen Zeehelm,
was designed to subvert their dominion over
the South River, is not justified, says Sprinchorn,
by evidence of the existence of any plan to recover
the colony, at that time, by force of arms.</p>

4to, xx + 192 pp. An ornamental titlepage bears
the legend: <i>Novæ Sveciæ seu Pensylvaniæ in
America Descriptio</i>. The work is dedicated to
King Charles XII. of Sweden, and is divided
into four books, the first of these treating of
America in general, the second of New Sweden,
and the third of the Indians in New Sweden,
and the fourth consisting of a vocabulary and
collection of phrases and some discourses in the
dialect of the same savages, with Addenda concerning
the Minquas and their language, and
certain rare and remarkable things in America.
It is embellished with numerous illustrations
besides those mentioned in the text; among
them being maps of America and of Virginia,
New England, New Holland, and New
Sweden, and one of New Sweden taken from
Nicholas Visscher, the two latter being given
in this chapter, and pictures of an Indian fort
and Indian canoes. An extract from a translation
of it is given in <i>N. Y. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>,
vol. ii. pp. 343 <i>et seq.</i> (New York, 1814). An
annotated translation of the whole work, by
Peter S. Du Ponceau, LL.D., reproducing Lindström’s
and Visscher’s maps of New Sweden,
and the representations of Trinity Fort, the
siege of Christina Fort, and the Indian fort,
above referred to, was published in <i>Memoirs of
the Historical Society of Pennsylvania</i>, vol. iii.
pt. i. pp. 1 <i>et seq.</i> (Philadelphia, 1834). The
work is rare. Copies are to be found in the
Philadelphia Library, in the libraries of the
Historical Society of Pennsylvania, Harvard
College and Congress, and in the Carter-Brown
collection. It is priced in recent catalogues as
high as £15 or £16. Cf. <i>Brinley Catalogue</i>,
no. 3,043-44; Sabin’s <i>Dictionary</i>, iii. 10,202;

Bibliography</i>, no. 233; <i>Menzies Catalogue</i>, no.
327; <i>O’Callaghan Catalogue</i>, no. 467. Few

making the author the son, instead of the grandson,
of the Rev. Johan Campanius Holm.</p>

assertion that the Swedes settled on the Delaware

are in the libraries of the Historical Society of
Pennsylvania and of Harvard College. Cf.

<i>Ifrån år 1523 in til närvarande tid. Uppå

Forsta del, Stockholm, 1747; andra del, ibid.,
1750; tredje del, ibid., 1753; fjerde del, ibid.,
1760; femte del, ibid., 1766; sjette del, ibid.,
1775. In the same author’s <i>Matrickel öfwer
Sweriges Rikes Ridderskap och Adel</i>, 1754, p. 350,
occurs a notice of Johan Printz, stating that after
his return from New Sweden he was made
a General, and in 1658 Governor of Jönköping.
It is added: “He was born in the parsonage of
Bottneryd, and died in 1663, without sons, the
family thus ending with him in the male line.”
As to these points compare, however, Prof. Dr.
Ernst Heinrich Kneschke’s <i>Neues allgemeines
Deutsches Adels-Lexicon</i>, vii. pp. 253-54 (Leipsic,
1867), art. “Printz, Printz v. Buchan,” which
speaks of Governor Printz as belonging to a
Lutheran branch of an old Austrian noble family
that emigrated to Holstein soon after the
Reformation, and finally settled in East Prussia.
According to this authority he had a son Johann
Friedrich, who became a Major-General in the
army of the Electorate of Brandenburg, and was
ennobled in 1661 under the name of Printz von
Buchan, whose descendants still live in Germany.
In mitigation of the blame attached by
Stiernman to Printz for the surrender of Chemnitz,

Winthrop (as Mr. Kidder supposes), but to another
(dated April 22, 1644) mentioned by Sprinchorn.
It is written in Latin, a language necessarily
used by the Swedish Governor in such
correspondence, though he felt his incompetence
for the task, saying in his report of the same
month that “for the last twenty-seven years he
had handled muskets and pistols oftener than
Cicero and Tacitus.” He therefore desired his
superiors to send him a Latin secretary, and, repeating
his request in his Report of 1647, hopes
that that person might render aid in administering
justice and solving intricate problems of
law, which occasionally arose, besides relieving
him from the embarrassment of appearing in
court in certain cases as both plaintiff and
judge.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
